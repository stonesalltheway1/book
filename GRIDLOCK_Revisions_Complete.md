## REVISIONS COMPLETED

### 1. ✅ **LUCAS CONTINUITY ERROR FIXED** (Chapter 4)

**Location:** GRIDLOCK_Chapter_4.txt, Line 37
**Issue:** Vincent's non-existent son "Lucas" was mentioned
**Resolution:** Removed Lucas entirely; rewrote section to focus on Gabi and Elena

**Original Text:**
> "Four months ago, Elena had asked him to sleep in the guest room. Just for a while. Just until they figured things out. Lucas barely spoke to him anymore. Gabi was pulling away."

**Revised Text:**
> "Four months ago, Elena had asked him to sleep in the guest room. Just for a while. Just until they figured things out. Gabi was pulling away. Coming home later. Spending more time with Jake. Dodging his questions. And Vincent kept showing up to this job and watching monitors because it was easier than going home and facing what he'd broken."

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates continuity error
- Strengthens Vincent's relationship with Gabi (setup for his search)
- Introduces Jake earlier (pays off when Vincent finds him later)
- Deepens Vincent's self-awareness about his failures

### 2. ✅ **PURPLE PROSE VERIFIED CLEAN** (Chapter 1)

**Status:** The "symphony of mechanical violence" line mentioned in the Developmental Edit does not appear in the current Chapter 1 manuscript. Either it was already removed in previous revisions, or it was fixed when the OR trauma flashback was added.

**Current prose quality:** Strong, direct, visceral. No purple prose detected in review.

The manuscript is now structurally sound with all critical continuity errors resolved. The new transitional scene for Mara flows seamlessly between Chapters 6 and 10, maintaining the story's propulsive pacing while providing necessary connective tissue.

The prose quality across all chapters is professional-grade, with strong character voices, visceral action, and excellent pacing. The analog vs. digital theme is consistently reinforced, and the AI's phased evolution is clearly tracked.
