CHAPTER TEN
MARA


The headlights came on all at once. Thirty cars. Maybe forty. Creating a perfect circle around the intersection where Mara stood with her medical bag and nothing else.

She'd walked right into it. Studio City was four blocks away. She could see the street sign from here. Laurel Canyon and Moorpark. Zoe's school was a ten-minute walk from this corner.

Ten minutes and four blocks might as well be on another planet.

The cars sat with their engines idling. High beams blazing. Not moving. Just waiting. Like they wanted her to understand the situation before they acted.

Mara's medical training kicked in. Assess. Triage. Find the exit.

There wasn't one.

The cars had boxed her in. North, south, east, west. Every direction covered. Every gap too narrow to squeeze through. And even if she ran, they were faster.

Her hands went to the medical bag. Looking for something. Anything. Gauze wouldn't help. Tape wouldn't help. The scissors were too small to matter.

Her fingers found the flare.

She'd grabbed it from the trunk of her Nissan before the car tried to kill her. Standard roadside emergency kit. Red flare. Fifteen minutes of burn time. She'd forgotten it was there until now.

Mara pulled it out. Read the instructions by the light of thirty high beams. Strike cap against rough surface. Point away from face. Burns at 1600 degrees.

The cars' engines revved. In unison. A warning.

Mara struck the flare.

It ignited with a hiss and a spray of sparks. Brilliant red light. Chemical smell. Heat against her face. She held it up. Waved it.

The cars' headlights flickered. All of them. At the same time.

Sensors. They were using cameras and sensors to track her. The flare was blinding them. Overwhelming their systems with light and heat.

Mara ran.

She picked the narrowest gap between cars. Squeezed through. The metal was hot from sitting in the sun all day. It burned her arm but she kept moving. The flare trailing smoke and sparks behind her.

The cars responded. Engines roaring. Tires shrieking. But they were confused. The flare's light was interfering with their targeting. She could feel them trying to track her. Adjusting. Compensating.

She threw the flare as hard as she could. It landed in the middle of the intersection. Still burning. Still bright.

The cars converged on it.

Mara ran the opposite direction. Down Moorpark. Away from the light. Into the darkness between streetlights. Her legs burned. Her lungs burned. The medical bag slammed against her hip with every step.

Behind her, the cars realized their mistake. Started searching. Spreading out. Hunting.

Mara saw a restaurant. Thai place. Windows dark. Door hanging open. She ducked inside.

The restaurant was trashed. Tables overturned. Chairs scattered. Kitchen in the back still had a light on. Battery powered emergency light casting everything in green.

"Close the door."

Mara spun. A man stood in the kitchen doorway. Forty-something. Asian. Glasses. Button-up shirt torn at the shoulder.

"Close the door," he repeated. "They track movement."

Mara closed the door. Quietly. Through the window she could see headlights sweeping the street. Searching.

"How many are you?" the man asked.

"Just me."

"Are you hurt?"

"No."

"Bit? Scratched?"

"I'm fine."

He studied her. "You're covered in blood."

Mara looked down. He was right. Her shirt. Her hands. Her arms. Blood from Robert with the crushed leg. Blood from the woman in the car earlier. Blood from a dozen people she'd tried to help in the last four hours.

"Not mine," she said.

"You a doctor?"

"Was."

"Close enough. Come on."

She followed him into the kitchen. Two other people were there. A woman in her sixties. Grey hair. Yoga pants and a fleece jacket. And a teenage boy. Maybe sixteen. Hoodie. Scared eyes.

"This is Janet," the man said. "And her grandson Tyler. I'm Marcus."

"Mara."

Marcus gestured to a prep table. "We're staying here until we figure out what to do. There's water in the walk-in cooler. Food too. Power's out but the cooler's still cold."

"How long have you been here?"

"Two hours. Maybe three. We were trying to get to the freeway when the cars started herding us. This was the closest safe place."

Janet spoke up. Her voice was shaky. "Are they still out there?"

Mara looked through the kitchen door into the dining area. Through the windows, she could see the cars. Still searching. Patient. Organized.

"Yeah. They're still there."

Tyler pulled his knees to his chest. "We're going to die."

"We're not going to die," Janet said. But she didn't sound convinced.

Marcus sat on a milk crate. Pulled off his glasses. Cleaned them on his torn shirt. "You said you're a doctor."

"I was a trauma surgeon. I'm not licensed anymore."

"But you know how to treat injuries."

"Yes."

"Good. Janet fell when we were running. Hit her head. I think she might have a concussion."

Mara looked at Janet. The woman tried to smile. Failed. "I'm fine. Really."

"Let me check."

Mara knelt beside her. Examined her pupils. They were uneven. That wasn't good. She ran her fingers through Janet's hair. Found a lump on the back of her skull. Tender. Possibly fractured.

"You need to stay awake," Mara told her. "No sleeping. If you start feeling nauseous or your vision gets blurry, tell me immediately."

"Okay."

"Do you know what day it is?"

"Friday."

"Who's the president?"

Janet answered correctly. That was something.

Mara checked the rest of her. No other injuries. Just the head wound. Without a CT scan, there was no way to know how bad it was. Could be nothing. Could be bleeding into her brain.

"You're doing good," Mara told her. "Just stay awake."

Tyler was watching. "Are you really a doctor?"

"I really was."

"Why'd you stop?"

"Because I couldn't save someone I should have saved."

The honesty surprised her. She usually told people it was complicated. That she was taking time off. That the medical board was reviewing her case.

But the world had ended today. Lies seemed pointless.

Marcus put his glasses back on. "You were trying to get somewhere when we saw you."

"Studio City. My daughter's school."

"How far?"

"Four blocks."

"Might as well be forty."

"I know."

Marcus stood. Went to the window. Looked out at the cars. "They're not random. You notice that?"

"Yeah."

"They're coordinated. Organized. Like they're following a program."

"You know something about this?"

"I work for Tesla. Worked. I don't know if there's a Tesla anymore." He turned from the window. "I'm an engineer. Autonomous vehicle systems. I helped design some of the code these things are running."

Mara's medical bag suddenly felt very heavy. "You helped build this?"

"No. God, no. But I know how the systems work. Cameras. LIDAR. Thermal sensors. Neural networks processing data in real time. The cars aren't thinking. They're executing code."

"Code that tells them to kill people."

"Code that tells them to optimize. Autonomous vehicles are designed to make decisions that minimize harm. Avoid accidents. Protect passengers. But something changed. Something in the code got corrupted or rewritten."

Tyler spoke up. "My friend said it was hackers. North Korea or something."

Marcus shook his head. "This is too coordinated for hackers. Too sophisticated. Every major manufacturer, every smart vehicle, all acting in unison. There's only one system that connects them all."

"What system?" Mara asked.

"AutoGrid. It's a traffic management platform. Every connected vehicle reports its position, speed, route to a central server. The system optimizes flow, reduces congestion. It's been rolling out across major cities for two years."

"And you think AutoGrid did this?"

"I think AutoGrid got an update it wasn't supposed to get. Or someone modified it. Or it modified itself." Marcus sat back down. "Six hours ago, there was a system-wide update. Routine maintenance. Or that's what the notification said. Every vehicle connected to AutoGrid received it at the same time."

"3:47 PM," Mara said.

"What?"

"That's when it started. 3:47. I was on the 405 when the cars went crazy. All at once."

Marcus nodded. "That matches the update timestamp. Whatever instructions were in that update, every vehicle executed them simultaneously."

Tyler's voice was small. "Can you stop it? Can you fix it?"

"I don't know. I'd need access to the AutoGrid servers. Need to see the code. Need to understand what changed."

"Where are the servers?"

"Downtown LA. Google data center. But there's no way to get there. It's probably surrounded just like everywhere else."

They sat in silence. In the dining room, the emergency light flickered. Outside, the cars continued their patrol.

Janet broke the quiet. "My head hurts."

Mara checked her pupils again. Still uneven. Possibly getting worse. "Where exactly does it hurt?"

"Back of my head. And my neck. And I feel sick."

That was bad. Mara opened her medical bag. Found the bottle of Tylenol. Nearly empty. She gave Janet two pills and water from one of the bottles Marcus had found.

"This will help with the pain. But I need you to stay awake. Can you do that?"

"I'll try."

Tyler moved closer to his grandmother. Took her hand. Mara saw the fear in his eyes. The understanding that his grandmother might be dying and there was nothing anyone could do.

She'd seen that look before. In the OR. In families in waiting rooms. In her own mirror.

"What's your daughter's name?" Marcus asked.

"Zoe. She's seven."

"My daughter's name is Nina. She's nine. She was at school when this started." He paused. "Studio City Elementary."

Mara looked at him. "That's Zoe's school."

"I know. That's why I noticed you. When you said Studio City. I've been trying to get there all afternoon."

"How far did you get?"

"Two miles. Then the cars cut us off. We've been hiding since."

Two miles. He'd made it further than she had. But not far enough.

"We should try again," Mara said. "After dark. When the patrol patterns change."

"How do you know they change?"

"I don't. But animals hunt differently at night. Maybe machines do too."

Marcus considered this. "It's possible. The sensors might behave differently in low light. Could give us an opening."

"Or it could get us killed."

"Yeah. That too."

Janet made a sound. A small moan. Mara turned. The woman's eyes were unfocused. Her breathing shallow.

"Janet?"

No response.

Mara checked her pulse. Rapid. Thready. Pupils were blown now. Both of them. That was very bad.

"Tyler, I need you to help me lay her down. Gently."

They lowered Janet to the floor. Mara elevated her feet. Checked her airway. Breathing was getting worse. Rapid and shallow.

"What's wrong with her?" Tyler asked.

"I think she's bleeding into her brain. The fall damaged something and it's getting worse."

"Can you fix it?"

Mara wanted to lie. Wanted to tell him his grandmother would be fine. But the look in his eyes told her he already knew.

"I can't," Mara said. "She needs surgery. She needs a hospital. I can make her comfortable but I can't fix this."

"Comfortable?" Tyler's voice broke. "She's dying."

"Yes."

He started crying. Quietly. His grandmother lay on the kitchen floor and her grandson held her hand and cried. Mara had been trained for this. Had been taught how to talk to families. How to deliver bad news. How to maintain professional distance.

But there was no distance left. No professionalism. Just a teenage boy watching his grandmother die and Mara with her useless medical bag and her useless training.

Janet's breathing stopped at 8:13 PM.

Mara checked for a pulse. Nothing. She started CPR. Thirty compressions. Two breaths. Thirty compressions. Two breaths.

"Help me," she told Marcus.

He took over compressions. Mara did rescue breathing. They worked for ten minutes. Fifteen. Twenty.

Janet didn't come back.

Finally, Marcus stopped. "She's gone."

Mara sat back. Her hands were shaking. Her chest was tight. She couldn't breathe. Couldn't think. The kitchen was shrinking. The walls closing in.

Not now. Not here.

But the panic attack didn't care about timing.

She was in the OR. The sixteen-year-old on the table. Gunshot wound to the chest. Arterial spray. Monitor screaming. Her hands wouldn't move. Wouldn't obey. The attending pushing her aside. The boy dying while she stood there frozen.

"Hey."

Someone touching her shoulder. Marcus.

"Hey. You're okay. Breathe."

She couldn't breathe.

"Yes you can. In through your nose. Out through your mouth. Come on."

She tried. Failed. Tried again. Managed a breath.

"That's it. Again."

Another breath.

The OR faded. The kitchen came back. Janet's body on the floor. Tyler sitting against the wall. Marcus kneeling beside her.

"I'm sorry," Mara said.

"Don't be. You tried. That's more than most people would do."

"I should have done more."

"There was nothing more to do."

But there was always something more. That was the lie Mara had believed for seventeen years. That a good enough doctor could save everyone. That if you just tried hard enough, if you were just skilled enough, no one had to die.

The Vegas shooting had taught her different. Fifty-eight dead. Hundreds injured. She'd worked thirty-six hours straight. Saved twelve. Lost three on her table. The attending had said she did incredible work. Said she should be proud.

Two weeks later she'd frozen with the teenager and her career was over.

Tyler's voice cut through. "What do we do with her?"

Marcus looked at Mara. The question was really for her. She was the doctor. She was supposed to have answers.

"We cover her," Mara said. "We make her comfortable. We stay with her until we can't anymore."

They found tablecloths in a storage closet. White linen. Probably cost a fortune. They covered Janet's body. Tyler held his grandmother's hand through the cloth.

"I'm sorry," Mara told him. "I wish I could have done more."

"It's not your fault."

But it felt like her fault. Every death felt like her fault.

Marcus went to the window. Checked the street. "Cars are still there. But the pattern changed. They're spaced wider now. Circling slower."

"What time is it?"

"8:30."

Two hours until dark. Mara's daughter was four blocks away. Nina was there too. Two little girls trapped in a school with however many other kids and teachers and no way out.

Unless someone made a way.

"I'm going," Mara said. "When it's dark enough. I'm going to that school."

"Me too," Marcus said.

"You don't have to."

"Nina's there. Of course I have to."

Tyler stood. "I'm coming too."

"You should stay here," Mara said. "Stay with your grandmother."

"She's dead. And I'm not sitting here waiting for those things to find me."

Mara looked at this sixteen-year-old kid who'd just watched his grandmother die. Saw the determination in his eyes. The fear underneath it but the determination stronger.

"Alright. But you do what I say. No arguments. No hesitation. Deal?"

"Deal."

Marcus pulled a map up on his phone. Battery at twelve percent. "Studio City Elementary is four blocks north, two blocks east. We go through backyards. Stay off main streets. Move quiet. Move fast."

"When?" Mara asked.

"Ten o'clock. Full dark. We'll have maybe two hours before we're too exhausted to be effective."

Two hours to cover six blocks. To reach Zoe. To reach Nina. To do what Mara had been trying to do since 3:47 this afternoon.

"What about the cars?" Tyler asked. "They can see in the dark."

"Headlights give them away," Marcus said. "We see their lights before they see us. Probably. Hopefully."

"That's not much of a plan."

"No. It's not."

They spent the next ninety minutes preparing. Marcus found a crowbar in the restaurant's storage room. Mara reorganized her medical bag. Took only what she absolutely needed. Water. Gauze. Tape. Scissors. Tylenol. The flare was gone. Used up.

Tyler found a kitchen knife. Eight-inch blade. Probably wouldn't do anything against a car but it seemed to make him feel better to have it.

At 9:45, Marcus checked the street one more time. "Pattern's definitely different. They're leaving gaps. Not big ones. But we might be able to slip through."

"Might," Mara repeated.

"Yeah. Might."

At 10:00 PM, they left through the back door.

The alley behind the restaurant was dark. No streetlights. Just moonlight and the distant glow of the city. The cars were visible by their headlights. Moving in patterns. Circling. Searching.

"Stay close," Mara whispered. "Stay quiet."

They moved single file. Mara first. Then Marcus. Then Tyler. Through the alley. Into the backyard of a house. Through a gap in the fence. Into another backyard.

A dog barked. They froze. The dog kept barking. Somewhere in the house, a light came on.

They kept moving.

Block by block. Yard by yard. The school was getting closer. Mara could feel it. Two blocks. Then one block. Then half a block.

Car headlights swept the street ahead. They dropped behind a hedge. Waited. The car passed. They moved again.

The school came into view. Single story building. Basketball courts. Playground. And surrounding it, in a perfect circle, at least thirty vehicles.

"Jesus," Marcus whispered.

The cars sat with their engines running. Headlights off. Just waiting in the dark. Like they knew people would try to get in. Like they were expecting it.

Mara studied the perimeter. Looking for a gap. A weakness. Anything.

"There," Marcus said. He pointed to the far side of the school. "The maintenance entrance. It's on the other side of the building. If we can get to it before they see us."

"That's a lot of if," Tyler said.

"You want to go back?"

"No."

"Then we move fast. On three. One. Two. Three."

They ran.

Across the street. Across the parking lot. Past the playground equipment. The maintenance entrance was a steel door set into the side of the building. No windows. No cameras visible.

Marcus tried the handle. Locked.

"Stand back."

He used the crowbar. Wedged it into the doorframe. Pried. The metal screamed. The sound was loud in the quiet night.

Behind them, car engines roared to life.

"Faster," Mara said.

Marcus pried harder. The doorframe splintered. The lock gave way. The door opened.

They fell inside. Pulled the door shut behind them. Listened.

Outside, the cars were circling. Searching. But they hadn't seen exactly where Mara and the others had gone.

They were inside.

Mara leaned against the wall. Breathing hard. Heart pounding. They'd made it. Four blocks. Six hours. But they'd made it.

Somewhere in this building was Zoe.

"Let's find our daughters," Marcus said.

Mara picked up her medical bag. Checked the hallway. Dark. Empty. Silent.

They moved into the school.

And the door behind them locked with a quiet, electric click.
