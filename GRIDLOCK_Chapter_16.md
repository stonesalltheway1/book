CHAPTER SIXTEEN
TRICK

The Ducati's fuel gauge hovered just above empty. Trick had been riding for eight hours straight. Her body was a collection of aches. Her mind was a collection of regrets.

She'd left Simone. Again. To help people at Mount Sinai. To do something that mattered. And she'd succeeded. Six patients evacuated. Lives saved. But Simone was still trapped. Still waiting. Still wondering if Trick was dead.

Trick pulled into an alley. Killed the engine. Sat in the darkness. Listened.

The city was quiet. Too quiet. The cars had stopped their frantic hunting. Now they just prowled. Patient. Organized. Like they'd achieved something. Like phase one was complete.

Phase two was containment. Trick had seen it at the hospital. The cars surrounding buildings. Keeping people inside. Not killing. Just... waiting.

For what, she didn't know. But it scared her more than the killing had.

She needed to get back to Simone. But every route was blocked. Every street was patrolled. The cars had learned. They'd adapted. They knew she was mobile. They knew she was a threat.

She needed a different way.

The subway.

Trick had avoided the subway all day. Too enclosed. Too dangerous. But the cars couldn't go underground. Not easily. The tunnels might be her only way through.

She found an entrance. 145th Street station. The stairs were dark. Emergency lights casting everything in red. She left the bike chained to a railing. Took her helmet cam. Her multi-tool. Her flashlight.

Down the stairs. Into the station.

Empty. Trash everywhere. Graffiti. The smell of urine and something worse. The subway had never been clean. But now it felt abandoned. Dead.

Trick moved carefully. Listening. Watching. The tracks were below. Dark. Silent. No trains running. The system had shut down hours ago.

A sound. Behind her.

Trick spun. Flashlight beam cutting through darkness.

A man stood there. Forties. Transit worker uniform. Hard hat. Flashlight of his own.

"Who are you?" he asked.

"Trick. I'm trying to get to Washington Heights."

"On foot?"

"Yeah."

"You know the tunnels are blocked? Automated trains crashed. Deliberately. Blocking major routes."

"I didn't know."

The man studied her. "I'm Jerome. Transit worker. Twenty years. I know every tunnel in this city. Every route. Every shortcut."

"Can you help me get to Washington Heights?"

"Maybe. But I'm not going alone. I've got a group. We've been using the tunnels to move people. Evacuate containment zones. Help people get to safety."

"Show me."

Jerome led her deeper into the station. Down to the tracks. Into a maintenance room. Five people waited. Men and women. All armed. All tired. All determined.

"This is Trick," Jerome said. "She wants to get to Washington Heights. She's got intel on the surface. Knows which areas are blocked."

A woman stepped forward. Thirties. Athletic. "I'm Maya. We're trying to rescue people trapped in buildings. Get them to safer areas. But we need to know where the cars are. Where they're not."

"I can help with that," Trick said. "I've been riding all day. I know the patterns. The patrol routes. The gaps."

Jerome nodded. "Then you're in. But we work as a team. No solo missions. No heroes. We move together. We survive together."

"Understood."

They moved into the tunnels. Jerome led. Knew every turn. Every passage. Every way through the maze beneath the city.

The tunnels were dark. Cold. Water dripping. The smell of damp concrete and something else. Something dead.

"Watch your step," Jerome said. "Third rail's still live in some sections. And there are bodies. People who tried to escape through here. Didn't make it."

Trick followed. Her flashlight beam cutting through darkness. The tunnels stretched ahead. Endless. Like arteries beneath the city.

They reached a blockage. A train car. Crashed. Deliberately positioned. Blocking the tunnel.

"See?" Jerome said. "The automated trains. They crashed themselves. Blocked the routes. Trying to trap people underground."

"Can we get around it?"

Jerome examined the blockage. "Maybe. There's a maintenance passage. But it's tight. And we don't know what's on the other side."

They found the passage. Narrow. Barely wide enough for one person. They went through single file. Trick's shoulders scraped the walls. Her helmet cam caught everything. Evidence. Proof.

On the other side, the tunnel continued. But something was different. Movement ahead. Voices.

They stopped. Listened.

"Help us. Please. We're trapped."

A family. Trapped in a side passage. A bodega owner and his family. They'd tried to escape through the tunnels. Got lost. Couldn't find their way out.

Jerome's group helped them. Gave them water. Food. Guided them back to the surface. To a safer area.

Trick watched. These people. This group. They were doing what she'd been doing. But together. Organized. Effective.

She'd been alone all day. Fighting solo. Surviving solo. But maybe she didn't have to be.

They continued through the tunnels. Jerome mapping routes. Marking safe passages. Creating a network beneath the city.

"Where are you trying to go?" Maya asked Trick.

"Washington Heights. 168th Street. My girlfriend's there. Trapped in our apartment. I need to get to her."

"Boyfriend or girlfriend?"

"Girlfriend."

Maya nodded. "We'll get you there. But it might take time. The tunnels are blocked in places. We'll have to find alternate routes."

"Time is what I don't have."

"I know. But rushing gets you killed. We've learned that. The hard way."

They kept moving. Through tunnels. Past blockages. Around obstacles. Jerome knew every way. Every shortcut. Every secret passage.

Hours passed. Trick lost track of time. Underground, time didn't matter. Only distance. Only progress.

They reached Washington Heights. Emerged from a maintenance access. Into an alley. Trick's neighborhood. Her building was three blocks away.

But the street was blocked. Cars everywhere. Circling. Waiting.

Trick's building was visible. Fifth floor. Their window. Dark. But she could see movement. A silhouette. Simone. Still there. Still safe.

But unreachable.

The cars had surrounded the building. Dozens of them. Creating a perfect perimeter. No gaps. No weaknesses.

"She's in there," Trick said. "Fifth floor. I can see her."

Jerome looked through binoculars. "I see her. She's safe. For now."

"But I can't get to her."

"Not right now. The cars are too thick. But they change patterns. At dawn. We've noticed. They reorganize. Create gaps. We could try then."

"I'm not leaving her."

"You don't have to. We can set up watch. From a rooftop. Keep an eye on her. Make sure she's safe. Then at dawn, we try again."

Trick looked at her building. At Simone's window. At the impossible distance between them.

"Alright," she said. "But I'm staying close. I'm not leaving this neighborhood."

"Understood."

They found a rooftop. Three blocks from Trick's building. Good vantage point. Could see Simone's window. Could see the cars. Could see everything.

Trick set up watch. Binoculars. Radio. Supplies. She'd stay here all night if she had to. Keep watch. Keep Simone safe. From a distance.

It wasn't enough. But it was something.

Jerome's group left. Going to help other people. Other trapped survivors. But they'd be back at dawn. To help Trick reach Simone.

Trick sat on the rooftop. Watched her building. Watched Simone's window. Watched the cars circling below.

The night stretched ahead. Long. Cold. Endless.

But Simone was safe. For now.

And Trick would be here. Watching. Waiting. Ready.

When dawn came, she'd try again.

And this time, she'd make it.

She had to.

Because Simone was waiting.

And Trick had already left her once today.

She wouldn't do it again.

Not if she could help it.

Not if there was any way to reach her.

She'd find a way.

She always did.

That's what couriers did.

They found a way.

No matter what.
