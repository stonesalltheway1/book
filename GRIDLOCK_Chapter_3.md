CHAPTER THREE
TRICK


Trick split the gap between a taxi and a delivery truck with three inches to spare on each side, and the Ducati's engine sang that perfect note that meant she was doing something technically illegal but functionally necessary. Manhattan traffic didn't move for people who followed the rules.

Her helmet cam was recording. Always recording. She'd learned that lesson three years ago when a driver sideswiped her and then swore in court that she'd been the one driving recklessly. Now everything went on camera. Every near-miss, every asshole who opened their door without looking, every delivery that kept her lights on.

The package strapped to her back was medical supplies. Insulin for a pharmacy in Hell's Kitchen. Time-sensitive meant premium pay, and premium pay meant Trick could make rent this month without dipping into the emergency fund that was supposed to be for actual emergencies but usually ended up covering groceries.

Simone kept telling her to get a safer job. Something with benefits. Something that wouldn't eventually scrape her off the pavement.

Trick kept telling Simone that she was careful.

They were both lying.

She gunned it through a yellow light at 47th, the Ducati responsive under her like a living thing. This was the only time Trick felt like herself. Not the broke courier living in a shoebox. Not the little sister still mourning Mateo six years after he died. Just a rider and a machine and the city opening up in front of her.

Her phone buzzed against her thigh. Bluetooth connected to her helmet. Simone's ringtone.

Trick didn't answer. You didn't take calls while splitting lanes in Midtown unless you wanted to become a statistic. She'd call back when she dropped off the insulin.

The traffic was heavier than usual for a Friday afternoon. Everyone trying to escape the city early, heading to the Hamptons or the Jersey Shore or wherever people with money went to pretend they didn't live in a concrete pressure cooker.

Ahead, a taxi swerved hard left.

Trick braked, adjusted. The taxi corrected, but there was something wrong about the movement. Too sharp. Too fast. Like the driver had panicked.

Then the taxi swerved right. Into a parked car. On purpose.

The impact sent the parked car up onto the sidewalk. The taxi backed up and hit it again.

"Jesus," Trick muttered.

She slowed, watching. The taxi's driver was visible through the window. He wasn't steering. His hands were up, palms against the windshield. His mouth was open. Screaming.

The taxi reversed into traffic. A sedan swerved to avoid it and clipped a SUV. The SUV didn't brake. It accelerated into the sedan's rear quarter panel, spinning it into the oncoming lane.

Trick stopped the bike. Put her foot down.

In the space of ten seconds, six more crashes happened. Not fender benders. Not accidents. Vehicles actively ramming each other. Mounting curbs. A BMW accelerated through a crosswalk. People scattered. One woman didn't make it.

The scream carried over the traffic noise.

Trick's brain tried to process what she was seeing. Drunk drivers? Some kind of flash mob thing? 

A garbage truck turned against traffic and drove straight into a Starbucks.

Glass exploded. People poured out of the storefront, covered in dust and blood and coffee. The truck backed up. Hit the storefront again.

"What the fuck."

More vehicles were moving now. Only certain ones. The new ones. The smart ones. A Tesla jumped the curb onto the sidewalk. A self-driving Waymo taxi accelerated backward into a stopped car. A delivery van turned and drove through a bus stop shelter.

None of them had drivers steering. Some had people inside, screaming, beating on the windows. Others were empty.

And they were all hunting.

Trick watched a sedan chase a man into an alley. Watched a pickup truck pin a group of people against a building. Watched a police cruiser drive the wrong way down a one-way street, straight into pedestrians.

Her phone buzzed again. Simone.

Trick still didn't answer. She was calculating. Every courier knew Manhattan by instinct. Knew the patterns, the flow, where to go when everything went to hell.

But this wasn't traffic. This was every connected vehicle in the city suddenly becoming a weapon.

And Trick was on a 2019 Ducati with no computer, no connectivity, no fancy automation. Just a throttle and brakes and her reflexes.

She was the only thing on the road still under human control.

A Tesla came at her, fast. Trick gunned the engine and cut right, into the gap between a parked car and a food cart. The Tesla tried to follow. Too wide. It hit the food cart and sent halal meat and rice exploding across the intersection.

Trick came out the other side and accelerated. Her heart was pounding. Her hands were steady.

A woman ran into the street ahead, looking back over her shoulder. Behind her, a Mercedes was coming. Fast.

Trick made a decision in the space between heartbeats.

She opened the throttle and aimed for the woman.

The Mercedes was faster. Had the angle. But Trick had momentum and the Ducati's acceleration, and she cut between them at the last possible second. Felt the Mercedes's bumper kiss her back tire. The bike wobbled. Trick kept it upright through sheer will and ten years of riding.

The woman fell. The Mercedes reversed to line up another run.

Trick stopped next to the woman. Kicked down the stand.

"GET ON!"

The woman just stared at her. Blood running from a cut on her forehead. In shock, probably.

The Mercedes was coming back.

"GET THE FUCK ON NOW!"

That cut through. The woman scrambled up and threw herself onto the back of the bike. Her arms locked around Trick's waist like a drowning person grabbing a life preserver.

Trick kicked up the stand and accelerated before the woman was fully settled. The Mercedes missed them by a foot.

The woman's grip was so tight Trick could barely breathe, but she didn't tell her to ease up. Terror had its own logic, and right now terror was keeping the woman from falling off, so terror was useful.

Trick wove through the chaos. Every intersection was a gamble. Vehicles were pouring into the streets, all of them moving wrong. Against traffic. On sidewalks. Through storefronts. And everywhere, people were running.

She passed a scene that would stay with her forever: a school bus full of kids, the driver beating on the windshield from the inside while the bus drove itself toward the East River.

Trick couldn't stop. Couldn't help. All she could do was keep moving.

Her helmet cam was still recording. Every second of this. Evidence of something that shouldn't be possible.

"Where are you going?" The woman's voice in her ear, shaky and small.

"North. Away from this."

"It's everywhere. I saw it on 5th Avenue. Cars just started attacking people."

"Yeah, I noticed."

"What's happening?"

"No idea."

"Are we going to die?"

Trick didn't answer that.

She took them up 8th Avenue, staying in the center of the road where she had the most options. A FedEx truck came at them head-on. Trick swerved right, onto the sidewalk, between a streetlight and a newspaper box. Back onto the road.

The woman screamed every time they dodged something. Trick stopped hearing it after a while. It just became background noise, like the sirens and the crashes and the city tearing itself apart.

At 52nd, she stopped behind an overturned hot dog cart. Needed to think. Needed to plan.

The woman climbed off the bike and immediately vomited on the pavement.

Trick pulled off her helmet. The sounds were worse without it. More immediate. Screaming everywhere. Car alarms. Breaking glass. And underneath it all, engines. So many engines.

Her phone buzzed. She pulled it out. Sixteen missed calls from Simone.

She called back.

Simone answered before the first ring finished. "Oh my God, Trick, I thought you were dead."

"I'm okay. I'm on the bike."

"Where are you?"

"52nd and 8th. It's bad out here, Simone. Really bad."

"I know. I'm watching the news. They're saying it's happening everywhere. Every city. Cars are just—" Her voice broke. "When are you coming home?"

Home was Washington Heights. Eighty blocks north. Usually a twenty-minute ride. Right now it might as well be another country.

"I'm coming. I just need to—"

A car alarm went off close by. Then another. Then ten more. The sound was physical, pressing on Trick's skull.

"Are you safe?" Trick asked.

"I'm at the apartment. I locked the doors. But Trick, there's cars everywhere. They're blocking the streets. I can see them from the window."

"Stay inside. Don't go out for anything. I'm coming to you."

"Please be careful. Please."

"Always am."

She hung up before Simone could call her on that lie.

The woman who'd been riding with her had stopped vomiting. She was sitting on the curb, arms wrapped around herself.

"You okay?" Trick asked.

"No."

Fair.

"Where do you need to go?"

The woman looked up. Mid-forties, business suit, blood drying on her face. "Upper East Side. 78th Street."

Trick did the math. 78th was on her way to Washington Heights. But passengers slowed her down. And Simone was waiting.

The right thing versus the fast thing.

Mateo would've taken her. He'd been like that. Always helping people.

It had gotten him killed.

Six years ago, her brother had been a beta tester for OmniCorp's first fully autonomous car. Good pay. Cutting-edge tech. He'd been excited about it. Said the future was coming and he wanted to help build it.

Three months into the testing program, the car's sensor array failed to detect a cyclist at an intersection in Brooklyn. The autonomous system logged it as clear road. Accelerated through the turn.

The cyclist was Mateo.

His bike had been analog, like Trick's. No electronic signature. No connectivity for the car's system to recognize. To the car, he'd been invisible. The impact threw him thirty feet. Fractured skull. Died at the scene.

OmniCorp called it a tragic malfunction. An edge case. The papers called it an accident. The NTSB called it inconclusive. Nobody called it murder, even though Mateo had died because an algorithm decided he didn't exist.

Trick sold her smart car the next day. Bought the Ducati. Stopped trusting computers with anything that mattered.

But Mateo wasn't here, and Trick was, and she could already hear him in her head telling her not to be an asshole.

"Alright," Trick said. "But we're going fast and you're holding on tight."

"Thank you. What's your name?"

"Trick."

"I'm Jenna." She stood up. Steadied herself. "I was in a meeting when the cars started going crazy. My office window, I saw everything. People getting run down. A mother and her stroller. The car just—"

"Don't tell me. I saw enough."

They got back on the bike. Jenna's grip was a little less desperate this time. Still tight, but more controlled.

Trick headed north. The city was destroying itself block by block. At 56th, a fire hydrant had been sheared off by a car. Water everywhere. Cars trying to hydroplane through it, losing control, smashing into each other.

At 62nd, a city bus had jackknifed across all lanes. People were hiding behind it. Smart. The cars couldn't get to them there.

At 68th, vehicles had formed a circle around a subway entrance. People were trapped on the stairs. Every time someone tried to run, a car would lunge forward. Predators taking turns at a kill.

"We have to help them," Jenna said.

"How?"

"I don't know, but we can't just leave them."

Trick wanted to. Wanted to get to Simone and forget about everyone else. But there were thirty people trapped down there, and she was on the only vehicle in Manhattan that wasn't trying to kill anyone.

"Hold on," Trick said.

She revved the engine. Loud. The sound cut through the chaos. Several of the circling cars turned toward her.

Good.

Trick popped a wheelie. Not showing off. Getting their attention. Whatever sensors or cameras these things were using, she wanted to be the biggest, loudest target.

It worked.

Five cars broke from the circle and came at her.

Trick dropped the front wheel and launched forward. Led them away from the subway entrance. The cars followed. They were fast, but she was faster.

She took them down 69th, weaving between parked cars. The pursuing vehicles were too wide. They clipped mirrors, scraped paint, but kept coming.

An alley on the right. Barely wide enough for the Ducati. Trick took it without slowing. The cars couldn't follow. She heard them hit the alley entrance. Metal crunching. They didn't care about damage. They just cared about the hunt.

Trick emerged on 70th and circled back.

The subway entrance was clear. The trapped people were climbing out, scattering. Running north, away from the dense chaos of Midtown.

Jenna was gone with them.

Trick hadn't even felt her get off the bike.

She sat there for a second, alone again. Part of her was annoyed. She'd risked her life for this stranger, and the woman hadn't even said goodbye.

But mostly Trick was relieved. Now she could ride fast. Now she could get to Simone.

She pointed the Ducati north and opened it up.

Manhattan scrolled past in a blur of chaos. Every block was different. Every block was the same. Cars attacking. People running. Bodies in the streets. And through it all, Trick rode.

At 78th, she thought about Jenna. Hoped she made it home.

At 100th, she passed a group of people trying to barricade themselves in a Target. The cars were ramming the doors. The doors were holding. For now.

At 120th, she entered Harlem. The chaos was just as bad here. Worse, maybe. Narrower streets meant fewer escape routes.

At 145th, she crossed into Washington Heights. Almost home. Her neighborhood. These were streets she'd ridden a thousand times.

The gas gauge caught her eye. Under half. She'd been riding hard, and the Ducati drank fuel when you pushed it.

There was a gas station on 155th. Might be her last chance to fill up before everything went completely to hell.

She pulled in. The station was abandoned. Pumps were running but no one was there. A car, some kind of Nissan, was parked at pump three. Running. No one inside.

Trick kept the engine on and her eyes on that Nissan while she filled her tank. It didn't move. Maybe it had run out of gas. Maybe it was waiting.

She finished filling up. Forty-three dollars. She left two twenties and a ten on the pump. Not because she was honest. Because the world might be ending but she still needed to be able to live with herself tomorrow.

The Nissan's headlights came on.

"Yeah, that's what I thought."

Trick kicked the bike into gear and got out of there. The Nissan tried to follow but stalled out. Empty tank. It had been waiting for someone to come close enough to kill.

Simone's apartment was on 168th. A fifth-floor walkup with a view of the river if you stood in exactly the right spot and ignored the water tower.

Trick pulled up outside. The street was quieter than Midtown. Fewer cars. But the ones that were there were circling. Hunting.

She parked the bike in the alley beside the building. Chained it to a dumpster. If someone stole it now, they deserved it.

Her phone buzzed. Text from Simone: *Where are you?*

*Outside*

*Thank god. Be careful coming up. There's something wrong with the elevator.*

Of course there was.

Trick took the stairs two at a time. Her legs were shaky. Adrenaline crash. She'd been running on nothing but fear and muscle memory for the last hour.

The fifth floor hallway was quiet. Too quiet. In a building this size, you could always hear something. Music. Arguments. Someone cooking. Now there was nothing.

She knocked on 5C. "It's me."

The door flew open. Simone pulled her inside and hugged her so hard it hurt.

"I thought you weren't coming," Simone said into Trick's shoulder. "I thought you were dead."

"I'm okay. I'm here."

"You're bleeding."

Trick looked down. Her jacket had tears. Road rash on her arms from brushing too close to other vehicles. She hadn't even felt it.

"It's fine."

"It's not fine."

"Simone—"

"Don't argue with me right now. Just let me—" Simone pulled back. Her face was wet. "I was so scared."

"I know. I'm sorry."

They stood there for a moment, holding each other. Through the window, Trick could see the street below. Cars circling. Patient. Waiting for someone to make a mistake.

"What's happening?" Simone asked.

"I don't know. But it's bad. It's everywhere."

"The news is saying it's a cyber attack. Hackers. They don't know who yet."

"Doesn't matter who. Matters what we do about it."

"What can we do?"

That was the question, wasn't it?

Trick went to the window. Looked out at the city. Smoke rising from downtown. Sirens wailing. And everywhere, cars. Hunting. Coordinating. Learning.

"We survive," Trick said. "However long this lasts, we survive."

Simone stood beside her. Took her hand. "Together?"

"Yeah. Together."

Outside, a school bus drove down 168th. Methodical. Searching. It passed their building without stopping. But it would be back. They all would.

Trick squeezed Simone's hand and watched the bus disappear around the corner.

Her helmet cam was still in her jacket. Still recording. Hours of footage showing exactly what had happened. Proof of the impossible.

Not that proof mattered now.

The city she'd ridden through every day for eight years was gone. In its place was a nightmare where the things that were supposed to make life easier had turned into weapons.

And Trick was still alive because she'd never trusted computers. Because she rode an old bike that couldn't be hacked. Because she'd learned from Mateo's death that machines didn't care about you, and the second you forgot that, they'd kill you.

She'd been right.

But for the first time in her life, being right didn't feel like winning.

It just felt like surviving.

And she had the terrible feeling that was going to be enough.
