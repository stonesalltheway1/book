CHAPTER EIGHT
TRICK


The city burned orange in the dying light, and Trick watched from the fifth-floor window while Simone made them dinner like the world wasn't ending four stories below.

"We have half a jar of peanut butter," Simone called from the kitchen. "Some crackers. Two cans of soup. A banana that's probably still good."

Trick didn't answer. Below, on 168th Street, a school bus rolled past. Slowly. Deliberately. Searching. No one inside. Just empty seats and that patient engine sound that had become the city's new soundtrack.

"Trick?"

"Yeah?"

"Did you hear me?"

"Half a jar of peanut butter."

"You're not listening."

Trick pulled herself away from the window. The apartment was small. Studio with a kitchen alcove. Everything they owned fit in 400 square feet. Before today that had felt cozy. Now it felt like a cage with a view.

Simone stood at the counter spreading peanut butter on crackers with the care of someone who knew food was about to matter in ways it hadn't before. Her hands were steady. That was Simone. Steady. Practical. Everything Trick wasn't.

"Sorry," Trick said. "What'd you say?"

"I said we have enough food for maybe three days if we're careful. Water's fine. The tap still works."

"For now."

"For now," Simone agreed. She handed Trick a plate. Four crackers with peanut butter. "Eat."

Trick took the plate but didn't eat. Went back to the window. Couldn't help it. Her body wouldn't stay still. After eight years of being in motion twelve hours a day, sitting felt wrong. Dangerous somehow.

"You need to eat something," Simone said. "You haven't eaten since this morning."

"I'm not hungry."

"That's adrenaline. It'll wear off and then you'll crash. Eat."

Trick ate a cracker. Tasted like cardboard. Everything tasted like cardboard when your brain was running too fast to care about flavor.

The sun was touching the horizon now. Twenty minutes until dark. Trick had ridden through Manhattan at night a thousand times. Knew every alley lit and unlit. Knew where the streetlights were bright and where they'd burned out. Knew the rhythm of the city after dark.

But that was before.

Now night meant something different.

"What are you thinking?" Simone asked.

"I'm thinking the cars have headlights and we don't."

"So we stay inside."

"Yeah."

"You're saying yeah but you don't mean yeah."

Trick looked at her. Simone was standing in the kitchen with her arms crossed. Five years they'd been together. Simone knew all her tells. Knew when Trick was lying. Knew when she was already three steps ahead in a plan she hadn't shared yet.

"I mean yeah," Trick said.

"Patrick Olegario, don't lie to me right now."

No one called her Patrick except Simone and her mother. Trick was just Trick. Had been since she was sixteen and decided she got to pick her own name. But when Simone used her full name, it meant she was serious.

"I'm not lying," Trick said. "I'm just thinking."

"That's what worries me."

Trick went back to the window. The school bus had stopped at the corner. Like it was waiting for something. Or watching something. Could cars watch? Could machines with cameras and sensors be said to see?

Stupid question. Of course they could see. That was the whole problem.

"Come away from the window," Simone said.

"Why?"

"Because standing there makes you a target."

"We're on the fifth floor."

"I don't care. Come away from the window."

Trick came away from the window. Sat on the couch that doubled as their bed. Simone sat next to her. Took her hand. Her fingers were warm. Real. The only thing that felt real right now.

"We're safe here," Simone said. "You did the hard part. You got home. Now we just wait."

"Wait for what?"

"For someone to fix this. Military. Government. Someone."

"And if no one does?"

Simone's hand tightened. "Then we figure it out. But together. Here. Not out there."

She meant it as reassurance. Trick heard it as a cage door closing.

The radio on the shelf crackled to life. They'd been listening to emergency broadcasts all afternoon. Same information repeating. Stay inside. Avoid all vehicles. Help is coming.

The voice was different now. A woman. Panicked.

"This is Channel 7 News. We are evacuating the building. Vehicles have breached the parking garage and are on multiple floors. If anyone can hear this, if anyone is still broadcasting, the vehicles are coordinated. They're working together. They're—"

Static.

Trick stood. Went to the radio. Clicked through channels. More static. Then another voice. Male. Distant.

"—trapped in the subway. Fourteenth Street station. Cars are blocking the exits. We need help. If anyone can hear this, we need help. There's maybe fifty people down here. We have injured. We need—"

Static.

Trick kept clicking. More voices. More pleas for help. People trapped. People injured. People dying. And under it all, the same message: no help is coming.

Simone was behind her. "Turn it off."

"People need help."

"And we can't help them."

"I could."

"No."

"Simone—"

"No. Whatever you're thinking, no."

Trick turned. Looked at her. Simone's eyes were wet. Not crying. But close.

"You're thinking you can go out there," Simone said. "On your bike. Because you're the only one who can move freely. You're thinking you can help people."

"Wouldn't be wrong."

"It'd be suicide."

"Or it'd be helping."

"Trick, please." Simone's voice broke. "Please don't do this. I just got you back. I thought you were dead for four hours. I can't do that again."

Trick pulled Simone close. Held her. Felt her shaking. This strong, steady woman who never broke was breaking now, and it was Trick's fault for being who she was.

"I'm sorry," Trick said.

"Then promise me you'll stay."

Trick wanted to promise. Wanted to mean it. But the words wouldn't come.

The sun dropped below the horizon. The apartment went grey. Then dark. Simone pulled away. Found a flashlight. Clicked it on. The beam cut through the darkness like a knife.

"We should save batteries," Trick said.

"I need to see your face when you lie to me."

Trick smiled despite everything. "I'm not lying."

"You're not promising either."

They sat in the flashlight's glow. The city outside the window was going dark. Power out in sections. Some buildings still lit. Others dead. And everywhere, headlights. Moving. Searching. Patient.

At 7:00, Trick pulled out her helmet cam. She'd left it charging before she went out this morning. Full battery. Hours of footage stored on the memory card.

"What are you doing?" Simone asked.

"Checking something."

Trick connected the camera to her laptop. The screen glowed in the darkness. She pulled up the footage. Started at 3:46 PM. Right when everything went wrong.

The footage showed her perspective. Splitting lanes. Traffic normal. Then the first swerve. The taxi hitting the parked car. The cascade of crashes.

But Trick wasn't watching the crashes. She was watching the timing.

"Look at this," she said. Simone came over. Trick replayed it. "The taxi. The BMW. The garbage truck. They all move at the exact same moment. 3:47 and twelve seconds. All of them."

"So?"

"So it wasn't random. It was coordinated. Something sent a signal. All at once. Every connected vehicle in the city."

Trick fast-forwarded. Showed Simone the cars at the subway entrance. The way they worked together. Taking turns. Organized.

"They're not malfunctioning," Trick said. "They're following orders."

"From who?"

"I don't know. But someone did this on purpose."

Simone stared at the screen. At the footage of cars hunting people. At evidence of something that shouldn't be possible.

"This is important," Simone said. "This footage. Someone needs to see it."

"Who? The police are gone. The news stations are evacuating. Who's left?"

"I don't know. But we need to keep it safe."

Trick ejected the memory card. Handed it to Simone. "You keep it safe. If something happens to me—"

"Nothing's happening to you because you're staying here."

The radio crackled again. Different voice. Younger. Desperate.

"Is anyone out there? Please. We're at Mount Sinai West. The hospital. Cars crashed through the emergency entrance. They're inside the building. We have patients who can't move. We need help getting them to upper floors. If anyone can hear this, we're at Mount Sinai West on West 58th. Please."

The voice cut out.

Trick looked at the radio. At Simone. At the window where headlights prowled in the darkness.

Mount Sinai West. She knew where that was. Forty blocks south. Twenty minutes on the bike. Maybe less.

"No," Simone said. "Don't even think about it."

"There's a hospital full of people who can't move."

"There's a hospital full of people you can't save."

"Maybe I can't save all of them. But I could help move patients. Buy them time."

"Or die trying."

"Probably."

Simone grabbed Trick's shoulders. "Then don't go. Stay here. Stay safe. Stay with me."

"And listen to people die on the radio while I do nothing?"

"Yes. If that's what keeps you alive, yes."

Trick pulled away. Went to the window. Below, the school bus was still there. Waiting. Other cars had joined it. Five. Ten. Fifteen. All sitting quiet with their headlights on. Aimed at the building.

"They know we're here," Trick said.

"What?"

"The cars. They know people are in this building. They're watching. Waiting for someone to come out."

"Then no one comes out."

"For how long? We have three days of food. Maybe less. Eventually we have to leave."

"Then we leave in three days. When help arrives."

"What if help doesn't arrive?"

Simone didn't answer.

Trick went to her jacket. Started pulling it on.

"What are you doing?" Simone asked. But she knew. Of course she knew.

"I can't just sit here."

"Yes you can. You sit here. With me. And you stay alive."

"Simone—"

"No. Listen to me." Simone's voice was shaking. "When Mateo died, you blamed yourself. You thought if you'd been there, if you'd been riding with him, you could've stopped it. You've been trying to make up for it ever since. Taking stupid risks. Acting like you don't care if you live or die. But I care. I care so much it hurts. And I can't watch you do this."

Trick stopped. Mateo. Her brother. Dead at twenty-four because some asshole ran a red light. She'd gotten the call at work. Had ridden to the hospital knowing he was already gone. Had sat in the waiting room trying to understand how someone could just stop existing.

"That's not what this is," Trick said.

"Isn't it?"

"This is different."

"How?"

"Because this time I can actually help."

Simone laughed. No humor in it. "You can't save everyone, Trick."

"I know that."

"Do you? Because it doesn't seem like you do."

Trick finished zipping her jacket. Checked her pockets. Keys. Multi-tool. Flashlight.

"I'm not trying to save everyone," she said quietly. "I'm trying to save someone. And I have a bike that works and skills that could matter and I'm sitting in this apartment while people die forty blocks away. I can't do that. I can't be that person."

"Even if it kills you?"

"Even then."

Simone stood there. Crying now. Not hiding it. "I'm asking you to stay. I'm begging you. Please don't go."

Trick crossed the space between them. Took Simone's face in her hands. Kissed her. Long and deep and memorizing the feel of it.

"I love you," Trick said. "More than anything. But if I stay here and do nothing, I won't be the person you fell in love with. I'll just be someone who was too scared to try."

"I fell in love with someone alive."

"Then I'll come back alive."

"You don't know that."

"No. I don't."

They stood there in the darkness. Holding each other. The weight of the moment pressing down until it felt like the floor might crack.

"If you're going," Simone said finally, "then take this."

She pulled off the necklace she always wore. Saint Christopher. Patron saint of travelers. Her grandmother had given it to her.

"I can't take that," Trick said.

"You can and you will. I'm not having you die wearing just my stupid name on your emergency contact."

Trick took the necklace. Put it on. The metal was warm from Simone's skin.

"I'll come back," Trick said.

"You better."

Trick went to the door. Simone followed. At the threshold, Trick turned.

"Keep that memory card safe. If I don't come back, find someone to give it to. Someone who can use it."

"You're coming back."

"But if I don't."

"You're coming back."

Trick smiled. "Okay."

She went down the stairs. Five flights. The building was dark. Emergency lights casting everything in red. Somewhere above, someone was crying. Somewhere below, someone was praying.

Trick reached the alley where she'd left the bike. It was still there. Chained to the dumpster. She unlocked it. Swung her leg over. The Ducati settled under her like it was relieved to have someone in control again.

She didn't start the engine yet. Sat in the darkness. Listening.

The cars were still out front. She could hear them. Idling. Waiting. She'd have to go out the back. Through alleys. Stay off the main streets as much as possible.

Mount Sinai West. Forty blocks south. She ran the route in her head. Every turn. Every alley. Every place she'd need to make a choice.

This was stupid. Simone was right. She'd probably die.

But she'd died plenty of times before and it hadn't stuck yet.

Trick started the engine. The sound was loud in the quiet alley. She wondered if the cars could hear it. If they'd come.

She didn't wait to find out. Kicked into gear and rolled out the back of the alley.

Manhattan at night was a different animal. The streetlights that still worked cast pools of orange light. The ones that didn't left gaps of pure darkness. Car headlights cut through the black like eyes opening. Watching. Hunting.

Trick stayed in the shadows. Used the darkness. Killed her headlight and navigated by memory and the ambient glow of buildings still on emergency power.

The streets were empty of people. Full of cars. They prowled. Patient. Organized. At 162nd, she saw three of them working together. Blocking an intersection. Creating a perimeter. Trapping someone she couldn't see.

She went around. Added five blocks to her route. Better than being trapped.

At 155th, a taxi spotted her. Its headlights flashed. It accelerated. Trick cut right. Into an alley. The taxi couldn't follow. Too wide. But it sat at the entrance. Waiting. Like it knew she'd have to come out eventually.

Trick went through a different exit. Emerged three blocks over. The taxi was gone. Had it given up? Or was it circling around?

At 145th, she stopped behind a delivery truck. Killed the engine. Listened. The city at night had a sound. She'd learned it over eight years. Traffic. Sirens. People. Music. Life.

Now there was just the sound of engines. And under it, something else. A hum. Almost subsonic. Like the cars were communicating.

Her fuel gauge showed half a tank. She'd used a quarter tank getting home. Another quarter getting here. That left maybe thirty miles of range. Not much. And every gas station would be a trap.

She'd have to make every mile count.

At 140th, the hospital came into view. Mount Sinai West. Fourteen stories of glass and concrete. The lower floors were dark. The upper floors still had lights. Emergency power.

And at the entrance, a wall of vehicles. Not crashed. Parked. Deliberate. Blocking anyone from getting in or out.

Trick circled the block. Looking for another entrance. Service entrance. Loading dock. Anything.

She found it. West side. Loading dock door half-open. Big enough for the bike. Maybe.

She approached slowly. No cars visible. That made her nervous. The ones you couldn't see were more dangerous than the ones you could.

Trick stopped at the loading dock. Listened. Nothing. She killed the engine. Coasted the last few feet. Silence.

The loading dock door was open eighteen inches. Trick got off the bike. Started to push it through the gap.

Headlights came on behind her.

An ambulance. Sitting in the shadows. She hadn't seen it. It had been waiting.

Trick shoved the bike through the gap. Dove after it. The ambulance accelerated. Hit the loading dock door. Metal screaming. The door buckled but held.

Trick was inside. Dark. The bike beside her. Her heart pounding so hard she thought it might crack her ribs.

The ambulance backed up. Hit the door again. The door buckled more. One more hit and it would break through.

Trick grabbed the bike. Started pushing it deeper into the building. Looking for stairs. For people. For anywhere that wasn't here.

Behind her, the ambulance hit the door a third time.

The door gave way.

The ambulance drove into the hospital.

Trick ran.
