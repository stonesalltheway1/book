CHAPTER NINE
VINCENT


The Shell station at 32nd Street and Shea had three bodies in the parking lot and a pickup truck with its engine still running. Vincent counted the bodies from fifty yards out. Force of habit. Assess before you commit. Two men, one woman. The woman was still moving. Crawling toward the convenience store entrance.

Vincent's water bottle was empty. Had been for an hour. The Phoenix sun was a physical weight pressing down on his shoulders. Seven o'clock and still ninety degrees. His shirt was soaked through. His legs felt like something borrowed from someone older.

He was forty-one. In Fallujah he'd been twenty-three.

The F-150 had run out of gas a mile back. Vincent had walked the rest. Left his baton in the truck. Kept the flashlight. Kept Gabi's phone and shoe in his cargo pocket where he could feel their weight with every step.

The woman at the gas station stopped crawling. Lay still.

Vincent waited. Watched the lot. Four cars sat at the pumps. All running. No drivers. He counted windows and angles. Exit routes. Cover positions. The military training was still there even if his body wasn't what it used to be.

Nothing moved except heat shimmer off the asphalt.

He crossed the lot at an angle. Using the gas pumps for cover. Reached the woman. Knelt beside her.

Late thirties. Hispanic. Deep gash across her temple. Not bleeding anymore. That was bad. Meant she'd lost too much already or her heart had stopped pumping it out.

Vincent checked for a pulse. Found one. Thready but there.

"Hey. Can you hear me?"

Her eyes opened. Unfocused. "My son."

"Where's your son?"

"The store. We were getting water. The car. It came out of nowhere."

Vincent looked at the convenience store. Glass door intact. Lights on inside. No movement visible.

"What's your son's name?"

"Marco. He's eight. I told him to hide."

"I'm going to check on him. You stay here."

Her hand grabbed his wrist. Weak grip. "Don't leave me."

Vincent had heard that before. Different desert. Different circumstances. Same desperation.

"I'll come back," he said.

He stood. Approached the store. The door was locked. He could see inside through the glass. Aisles ransacked. Coolers open. Cash register empty.

"Marco?"

No answer.

Vincent tried the door again. Definitely locked. He looked around. Found a chunk of concrete from a broken planter. Used it to break the glass. The sound was loud in the quiet lot.

He climbed through. Glass crunching under his boots.

The store smelled like spilled beer and something rotting. The power was on but the refrigeration had failed. Everything in the coolers was warm.

"Marco. Your mom sent me. I'm here to help."

Movement in the back. Behind the counter.

Vincent moved slowly. Hands visible. Non-threatening posture. "Marco. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm looking for my daughter too. Her name's Gabi."

A boy appeared. Eight or nine. Dark hair. Terrified eyes. Holding a kitchen knife that looked too big for his hands.

"Where's my mom?"

"She's outside. She's hurt but she's alive. I need you to help me get her inside."

"The cars are out there."

"I know. But they're not moving right now. We have to be fast."

Marco looked at the knife in his hands. At Vincent. At the broken door.

"Okay."

They moved together. Vincent went first. Checked the lot. Still clear. The boy followed. They reached his mother. She was unconscious now but still breathing.

Vincent lifted her. She was light. Too light. He carried her back to the store. Marco held the door. They got inside. Vincent laid her on the floor behind the counter. Used his shirt to pillow her head. His undershirt was grey with sweat and dirt.

"You know first aid?" Vincent asked.

Marco shook his head.

"Then just stay with her. Talk to her. Let her know you're here."

"What are you going to do?"

"Find supplies. Water. Something for her head wound."

Vincent moved through the store. Found water bottles. Found a first aid kit that had been picked over but still had gauze and tape. Found energy bars. Found a carton of cigarettes. He didn't smoke anymore but he took them anyway. Barter material.

He brought the supplies back. Cleaned the woman's wound. The gash was deep but clean. He packed it with gauze. Used tape to hold it. Not ideal but better than nothing.

Marco watched. "Is she going to die?"

Vincent had heard that question before too. Different desert. Different kid. He'd lied then.

He lied now.

"No. She's going to be fine."

Marco's shoulders dropped. Relief. Trust. The weight of someone else's hope.

Vincent sat with his back against the counter. Opened a water bottle. Drank half. Gave the rest to Marco.

"When did it start?" Vincent asked.

"Around four. We were driving home. The car just went crazy. Started hitting other cars. My mom pulled the emergency brake but it didn't work. We crashed into a wall. Got out and ran here."

"You been here since then?"

"Yeah. There's other people. In the back. Hiding."

Vincent looked toward the storage room. "How many?"

"Five. Six maybe."

"They armed?"

"I don't know."

Vincent stood. His legs protested. He ignored them. "Stay with your mom. I'm going to check."

He found them in the storage room. Six people. Four men, two women. Range of ages. All scared. One of the men had a tire iron. Another had a pistol.

The one with the pistol stood when Vincent entered. "Who are you?"

"Vincent Reyes. I was looking for my daughter. Found people who needed help."

"You alone?"

"Yeah."

The man studied him. Forty-something. Mechanic maybe. Grease under his fingernails. "I'm Raul. This is my brother Carlos. That's my station out there."

"Your people okay?"

"Shaken. You?"

"I'm fine."

Raul holstered the pistol. Not tucked away. Just lowered. "You military?"

"Was. Long time ago."

"Shows." Raul gestured to the others. "These folks were here when it happened. Customers. We've been trying to figure out what to do."

"Stay put," Vincent said. "Stay quiet. Wait for help."

"Help ain't coming," Carlos said. "We've been listening to the radio. Every city. Every state. All the same. Cars killing people."

One of the women spoke up. Older. Grey hair. Teacher maybe. "My daughter lives in Anthem. North of here. I need to get to her."

"How far?" Vincent asked.

"Twenty miles. Maybe twenty-five."

"You're not walking that."

"Then what am I supposed to do? Just wait here?"

Vincent didn't have an answer. He was trying to walk twelve miles in Phoenix heat and he was already running on empty. Twenty-five was impossible.

"We have to do something," the teacher said. "We can't just hide."

"She's right," another man said. Young. College age. "My roommate texted me two hours ago. He's trapped at ASU. Says cars are surrounding the dorms."

"Surrounding?" Vincent asked.

"Yeah. Not attacking. Just circling. Like they're keeping people inside."

Vincent thought about that. The pattern at the mall. The way the cars had moved in coordinated sweeps. Not random. Purposeful.

"Anyone here see where people were heading?" Vincent asked. "Survivors. Anyone on foot."

Raul nodded. "Saw a group heading north on Tatum about an hour ago. Maybe fifteen people. Said they were going to a community center."

"Which one?"

"Desert Ridge. About three miles from here."

Vincent knew the area. Community center. Swimming pool. Basketball courts. Big parking lot. If people were gathering there, maybe someone had seen Gabi.

"I need to get there," Vincent said.

"On foot?"

"Unless you're offering a ride."

Raul laughed. No humor in it. "Everything with an engine is trying to kill us. I got a '98 Chevy in the garage bay but it's torn down. Won't run for days."

"What about bikes?"

"You see any bikes?"

Vincent hadn't. The store didn't sell them.

Carlos spoke up. "There's a sporting goods store two blocks west. Big 5. They'd have bikes."

"Is it locked down?"

"Was when we passed it. But the windows are smashed. People been looting."

Vincent checked his watch. Seven-fifteen. Maybe two hours of light left. Three miles to the community center. Another hour of walking if he pushed it. If the heat didn't drop him first.

"I need supplies," Vincent said. "Water. Food. Anything I can carry."

Raul gestured to the store. "Take what you want. We're not exactly doing business."

Vincent gathered what he could. Six water bottles. Energy bars. A small backpack someone had left behind. He filled it. The weight was manageable. Barely.

Marco appeared in the doorway. "My mom woke up."

Vincent went to her. She was conscious. Lucid. In pain but aware.

"Your boy did good," Vincent told her. "He's brave."

"Like his father was." She tried to sit up. Winced. "Thank you for helping us."

"You're welcome."

"Where are you going?"

"Looking for my daughter."

The woman reached for his hand. Squeezed it. "I hope you find her."

Vincent didn't know what to say to that. Hope felt like a luxury he couldn't afford. He just nodded.

He left through the back exit. Raul and Carlos walked him to the edge of the lot.

"You need this," Raul said. He held out the pistol. A Glock 19. Fifteen rounds.

Vincent looked at it. "You sure?"

"I got the tire iron. And I'm staying here. You're walking into it." Raul pressed the gun into Vincent's hand. "Probably won't do much against a car. But it might buy you a second to run."

Vincent checked the magazine. Full. He chambered a round. The weight of the gun was familiar. Comforting in a way that made him uncomfortable.

"Thanks."

"Find your daughter."

Vincent walked west. Stayed close to buildings. Used cars for cover when he had to cross open spaces. The gun was in his waistband. The backpack heavy on his shoulders.

The Big 5 was exactly where Carlos said. Windows smashed. Door hanging open. Inside was chaos. Racks tipped over. Products everywhere. But bikes were still there. Most of them. People had taken food and water. Not bikes. Yet.

Vincent found a mountain bike. Black. Twenty-one speed. Good tires. He wheeled it outside. The seat was too low. He adjusted it. His hands shook with fatigue.

The ride to Desert Ridge took twenty minutes. Downhill for most of it. Vincent's legs burned anyway. He hadn't been on a bike in years. His lower back was cramping by the time he reached the community center.

The parking lot was full of people. Maybe sixty. Seventy. Hard to count. They'd set up a perimeter using cars they'd pushed into position. Manual labor. No engines. Creating a barrier.

Guards at the entrance. Two men with baseball bats.

Vincent got off the bike. Walked it toward them. Hands visible.

"I'm looking for someone," he said. "Teenage girl. Seventeen. Dark hair. Name's Gabriela Reyes."

One of the guards shook his head. "We got a lot of people here. Don't know everyone's name."

"I need to check."

"You bit?"

Vincent blinked. "What?"

"Bit. Scratched. Injured. We're not taking anyone who might be infected."

"Infected with what?"

"Whatever's making the cars crazy. Could be a virus. Could be in people too."

Vincent stared at him. The stupidity of it. The fear making people irrational.

"The cars are hacked," Vincent said. "It's not a disease."

"You a doctor?"

"No."

"Then you don't know."

Vincent's hand moved toward the gun without thinking. He caught himself. Stopped. These were scared people protecting other scared people. Getting shot over a misunderstanding wouldn't help Gabi.

"Look," Vincent said. "I'm not sick. I'm not bit. I just need to find my daughter. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking."

The guards looked at each other. Some silent communication passed between them.

"Five minutes," the first one said. "You cause trouble, we throw you out."

"Understood."

They let him through.

The community center was organized chaos. People grouped by family. By neighborhood. By who knew who. Someone had set up a medical station. Someone else was distributing water. A third group was trying to establish radio contact with other survivors.

Vincent walked through. Looking. Searching faces. Most were adults. Some elderly. Not many teenagers.

He found the medical station. A woman in scrubs was treating a man's burned arm.

"Excuse me," Vincent said. "I'm looking for my daughter. Gabriela Reyes. Seventeen. She was in a car crash on the 101."

The woman looked up. Tired eyes. "We've had a lot of crash victims come through. Do you have a picture?"

Vincent pulled out his phone. Dead battery. Of course. He tried to describe her. "Five foot six. Dark hair. Brown eyes. She was wearing a Westview High hoodie."

"Sorry. Doesn't ring any bells. But there's a lot of people here. Check the rec room. That's where most of the younger folks are."

Vincent found the rec room. Twenty people. Teenagers mostly. Some in their twenties. They'd set up in a corner. Their own space. Their own rules.

Gabi wasn't there.

But Jake was.

Vincent recognized him immediately. The boy who'd been driving his daughter. The boy whose parents bought him a self-driving car. The boy who was supposed to be studying calculus.

Jake was on a couch. Wrapped in bandages. Left arm in a makeshift sling. Bruising across his face like someone had beaten him with a pipe. His eyes were closed. Breathing shallow.

Vincent crossed the room. Knelt beside the couch.

"Jake."

The boy's eyes opened. Took a moment to focus. "Mr. Reyes?"

"Where's Gabi?"

"I..." Jake's eyes lost focus. Found it again. "The crash. We crashed."

"I know. I found the car. Where did she go?"

"She ran. I told her to stay but she ran."

Vincent's chest went tight. "Where? Which direction?"

"I don't know. I was hurt. Couldn't see. She said something about her mom. About finding her mom."

Elena. Gabi had been looking for Elena.

"Did she say where her mom was?"

"Downtown. Some building. I don't remember." Jake's breathing was getting faster. Panicked. "Is she okay? Did you find her?"

Vincent wanted to shake him. Wanted to grab this kid and force every detail out of him. But the boy was injured. Delirious. Probably had a concussion.

"Jake, this is important. Try to remember. Did she say which building? What street?"

"The tall buildings. That's all she said. The tall buildings where Mom works."

Vincent stood. The tall buildings. Downtown Phoenix. Elena was a paralegal at Keller & Associates. Sixteenth floor of the Renaissance Center. He'd been there once for their anniversary. Years ago. Before everything broke.

"Mr. Reyes?"

Vincent looked back.

"I'm sorry," Jake said. "I tried to stop the car. I tried to keep her safe."

"I know you did."

It might have even been true.

Vincent left the rec room. Found the woman in charge. A community organizer type. Clipboard. Radio. Authority in the way she held herself.

"I need to get downtown," Vincent told her. "To the Renaissance Center."

"Downtown's the worst area," she said. "We've had reports of massive vehicle activity. They're surrounding the big buildings. Convention center. High rises. Anywhere large groups gathered."

"I think my daughter's there."

The woman's expression softened. "I'm sorry. But going downtown is suicide. Wait here. Eventually help will come."

"How long?"

"I don't know."

"Then I can't wait."

Vincent went back to his bike. The sun was low now. Forty-five minutes until dark. Downtown was eight miles. Maybe ten. He could make it if he pushed. If the cars didn't find him. If Gabi was actually there.

A lot of ifs.

Someone called his name. He turned.

The teacher from the gas station. The one with a daughter in Anthem. She'd made it here. Was standing near the perimeter.

"You leaving?" she asked.

"Yeah."

"Where?"

"Downtown. Renaissance Center."

"That's a death trap."

"Probably."

She looked at him. Really looked at him. "Your daughter in there?"

"I think so."

The teacher nodded. Understanding. "My daughter's trapped in Anthem. Cars surrounding her neighborhood. I should try to get to her. But I'm too scared."

"Being scared is smart."

"Then why are you going?"

Vincent looked at the bike. At the road leading downtown. At the darkening sky.

"Because if I don't try, I'll have to live with that. And I've already got too much I'm living with."

The teacher touched his shoulder. "I hope you find her."

"Me too."

Vincent got on the bike. Started pedaling. Behind him, the community center's perimeter grew smaller. Ahead, the Phoenix skyline rose against the sunset. Glass and steel towers that probably held thousands of people. Trapped. Surrounded. Waiting.

Somewhere in one of those buildings was his daughter.

And Vincent was riding into the worst of it to find her.

His legs burned. His back screamed. The Glock pressed against his spine with every pedal stroke.

But he kept moving.

Because that's what fathers did. Even the ones who'd failed at everything else. Even the ones who barely knew their own daughters anymore. Even the ones who were too late too often.

They kept moving.

The sun touched the horizon. The sky went orange then purple then grey. The buildings downtown were dark silhouettes now. And between them, running in the streets, prowling the intersections, were the lights.

Hundreds of headlights. Maybe thousands.

All circling the tall buildings.

All waiting.

Vincent pulled the bike to a stop at the edge of downtown. Half a mile from the Renaissance Center. Close enough to see it. Close enough to see the vehicles surrounding it like a moat made of steel and glass.

He'd found where Gabi had gone.

Now he just had to figure out how to reach her.

In the dark.

With a thousand cars standing between them.

Vincent sat on the bike and looked at the impossible task ahead of him.

And started planning anyway.

Because that's what soldiers did.

Even the broken ones.
