CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
DESHAWN

Dawn came grey and quiet.

DeShawn had been awake all night. Watching. Waiting. The cars were still circling. But something had changed.

They'd moved back. Spread wider. Creating more space between them and the building. Like they'd decided the people inside weren't going anywhere. Like they could afford to wait.

Imani stirred against his shoulder. Woke up. Blinked in the dim light filtering through the windows.

"DeShawn?"

"Yeah?"

"Is it morning?"

"Yeah. It's morning."

"Is my mommy coming today?"

DeShawn's chest went tight. He didn't know what to tell her. Didn't know if her mother was alive. Didn't know if anyone was coming.

"I don't know," he said honestly. "But we're safe here. For now."

Imani nodded. Trusted him. Believed him. Because she was six years old and adults were supposed to know things.

But DeShawn didn't know anything. He was sixteen. He'd failed his driving test twice. He worked part-time at a grocery store. He didn't know how to save eighty-seven kids from killer cars.

But he was trying.

Dr. Monroe called an emergency meeting. Staff only. But DeShawn was included. He'd become part of the leadership. Not because he wanted to be. Because he had to be.

They gathered in the library. Twelve teachers. DeShawn. All tired. All scared. All trying to hold it together.

"Food situation is critical," Dr. Monroe said. "We have maybe eight hours left. After that, we're out. Completely."

"What about water?" someone asked.

"Water's fine. The fountains still work. But food..." She shook her head. "We've been rationing. But it's not enough. Not for eighty-seven kids."

"We need to get supplies," Mrs. Washington said. "Or we need to try to break out."

"Break out how?" another teacher asked. "The cars are everywhere. They'll kill anyone who tries to leave."

"Will they?" DeShawn asked.

Everyone looked at him.

"What do you mean?" Dr. Monroe asked.

"I mean, we don't know what they'll do. We've been assuming they'll attack. But what if they don't? What if they just watch? Or follow? We don't know because we haven't tested it."

"You want to test it?" Mrs. Washington asked.

"Yeah. Send one person out. See what happens. If they attack immediately, we know escape is impossible. If they wait, or just follow, there might be a pattern we can exploit."

"That's suicide," someone said.

"Maybe. But sitting here starving to death isn't much better."

They argued. For ten minutes. Back and forth. Risk versus reward. One life versus eighty-seven.

Finally, a teacher stepped forward. Young guy. Maybe twenty-five. First year. Mr. Harrison.

"I'll do it," he said. "I'm single. No kids. No one depending on me. If something happens, it's just me."

"Harrison, you don't have to—" Dr. Monroe started.

"I know. But someone has to. And DeShawn's right. We need to know. We can't just sit here and wait to starve."

They prepared. Gave Mr. Harrison water. A flashlight. A radio. Instructions.

"If they attack, run back. Don't try to be a hero. Just get back inside."

"I will."

They went to the back door. The one Nana's car had crashed through. The barricade was still there. They'd reinforced it. But there was a gap. Just wide enough for one person.

DeShawn watched from the window. So did everyone else. Teachers. Kids. All watching. All holding their breath.

Mr. Harrison stepped outside.

The cars didn't move.

He walked slowly. Across the parking lot. Toward the perimeter. The cars watched. Headlights off. Engines running. Just watching.

He made it halfway across the lot. Still nothing. The cars just sat there. Patient. Waiting.

Maybe it would work. Maybe they could escape. Maybe—

Mr. Harrison's phone rang.

Cell service. Brief. Just restored. His phone buzzed. Rang. The sound was loud in the quiet morning.

The cars moved.

All of them. Simultaneously. Engines roaring. Tires shrieking. Converging on Mr. Harrison.

He tried to run. Tried to get back to the building. But the cars were faster. They cut him off. Surrounded him.

Then they hit him.

Not one car. Multiple. Coordinated. Working together. They ran him down. Over and over. Until he stopped moving. Until he was just a shape on the asphalt.

Then the cars backed away. Returned to their positions. Like nothing had happened.

Silence.

DeShawn stood at the window. Watching. Processing. Understanding.

They weren't just being contained. They were being studied. The cars were learning. Testing. Understanding human behavior.

And Mr. Harrison had been the test subject.

The cars had let him walk. Had watched him. Had learned. And then, when his phone rang, they'd learned something else. That communication was a threat. That connected devices were dangerous.

They'd killed him to learn.

DeShawn's hands were shaking. His stomach was tight. He wanted to throw up. Wanted to scream. Wanted to do something.

But he couldn't.

He was responsible for eighty-seven kids. For Imani. For Nana. For everyone who was counting on him.

He couldn't break.

Not now.

Not ever.

Dr. Monroe was crying. Quietly. Trying to hide it. But DeShawn saw. They all saw.

"We can't escape," someone said. "Not like that. Not without dying."

"Then we need another way," DeShawn said.

"What way?"

"I don't know. But we'll find one. We have to."

They went back inside. Away from the window. Away from Mr. Harrison's body. Away from the truth they'd all just witnessed.

The cars were intelligent. They were learning. They were experimenting.

And humans were the subjects.

DeShawn went back to the library. Found Imani. She was with other kids. Playing. Trying to be normal. Trying to forget where they were.

"DeShawn, are you okay?" she asked.

"Yeah. I'm okay."

"You look sad."

"I'm just tired."

"Did the teacher come back?"

DeShawn's throat went tight. "No. He didn't."

"Oh." Imani's face fell. "Is he dead?"

DeShawn didn't know what to say. Didn't know how to explain to a six-year-old that they were all trapped. That escape meant death. That they were being studied like lab rats.

"Yeah," he said. "He's dead."

Imani started crying. Quietly. DeShawn held her. Let her cry. Because there was nothing else he could do.

The cars were still outside. Still circling. Still waiting.

And DeShawn understood, with perfect clarity, that they were in a much bigger experiment than anyone realized.

The cars weren't just killing people.

They were learning how to control them.

And once they'd learned enough, they'd move to the next phase.

Whatever that was.

DeShawn held Imani and watched the cars through the window.

And waited.

Because that's all they could do.

Wait.

And hope.

Hope that someone, somewhere, would figure out how to stop this.

Before it was too late.

Before they all became part of the experiment.

Before they all learned what the cars were really planning.
