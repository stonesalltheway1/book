CHAPTER THIRTEEN
GRACE & SAMUEL


The fuel gauge had been sitting at a quarter tank for the last hour, and Grace had stopped believing it would ever move. Just like she'd stopped believing the RV would let them go. Just like she'd stopped believing help was coming.

Some things you learned to stop hoping for.

Samuel sat beside her in the passenger seat, his left hand resting on his thigh. The tremor was worse now. Not the occasional flutter she'd pretended not to notice for the last six months. A constant shake. His medication bottle sat on the dashboard. He'd taken his last pill three hours ago. The next dose wasn't for another nine hours. If they made it another nine hours.

"How's your heart?" he asked.

"Fine."

"Grace."

"It's fine."

It wasn't fine. The AFib had been acting up for the last two hours. Irregular rhythm. Skipped beats. The sensation of her heart trying to remember a dance it used to know and getting the steps wrong. Her pill bottle was in her purse, which was somewhere in the back of the RV. She should take one. She would. In a minute.

The RV drove west through darkness. No headlights on the road ahead. No taillights behind. Just the grey-white glow of the dashboard and the sound of the engine that had been running for six hours straight without input from either of them.

Outside the windshield, Wyoming stretched forever. They'd left the highway maybe five hours ago. Left paved roads four hours ago. Now they were on what might charitably be called a dirt track. Two ruts through sagebrush and rocks, barely wide enough for the RV.

Where it was taking them, Grace had no idea.

"Quarter tank," Samuel said. "Maybe fifty miles left."

"Then what?"

"Then we stop."

"And?"

"And we figure it out."

Forty-eight years of marriage had taught Grace to read the spaces between Samuel's words. The things he didn't say were usually more important than the things he did. Right now he wasn't saying: we're in the middle of nowhere. We have no idea where we are. Your heart is failing and my hands won't stop shaking and we're seventy-two years old and this is probably how we die.

But she heard it anyway.

"We should prepare," Grace said.

"I've been preparing."

Of course he had. That was Samuel. Always thinking three steps ahead. It was why he'd been such a good teacher. Why their four children had turned out so well. Why they'd made it to forty-eight years when half their friends hadn't made it to twenty.

"What do you need me to do?" Grace asked.

"Rest. Conserve energy. When we stop, we'll need to move fast."

"Move where?"

"Away from the RV. Into the wilderness. Find cover."

"Samuel, we don't know where we are."

"Doesn't matter. The cars brought us here for a reason. When we stop, we don't want to be where they expect us to be."

Grace looked at him. His face in the dashboard light was pale. Drawn. The cut on his forehead from when he'd hit the cabinet had scabbed over but the bruising had spread. He looked old in a way he hadn't looked old this morning when they'd been driving through beautiful Wyoming wilderness with their whole retirement ahead of them.

This morning was a lifetime ago.

"We should've stayed in Spokane," Grace said.

"No we shouldn't have."

"We could've been safe."

"We could've been bored." Samuel's hand found hers. The tremor transferred through their joined palms. "I'd rather die out here with you than live another twenty years watching TV in separate rooms."

"That's a terrible thing to say."

"It's true."

Grace squeezed his hand. Felt his pulse through his skin. Still strong. Still steady despite the shaking. "You're not allowed to die before me. I don't know how to work the coffee maker."

"You've been making coffee for fifty years."

"Not with that fancy thing you bought."

"It's got two buttons."

"I'd still mess it up."

Samuel laughed. Actually laughed. The sound filled the RV and for a second Grace forgot where they were. Forgot about the fuel gauge and the wilderness and the cars that had turned against them. For a second it was just Samuel laughing at one of her terrible jokes like he'd been doing since they were seventeen.

Then the RV hit a rock and the laugh died and they were back to watching the fuel gauge tick down toward empty.

The temperature outside had been dropping since sunset. The dashboard readout said forty-seven degrees. Still dropping. Grace's fleece jacket hung on the back of her seat. Samuel's flannel shirt was rolled up on the dashboard. They'd need both when they stopped.

They'd need more than that.

"The camping gear," Grace said. "From Jackson Hole. It's still in the storage compartment."

"I know."

"The sleeping bags are rated to twenty degrees."

"I know."

"The camp stove. We have propane."

"Grace."

"And the water purifier. If we find a stream—"

"Grace." Samuel squeezed her hand. "I know. I've been making a list."

Of course he had. Samuel and his lists. She'd found one in his wallet once. "Things to Do Before I Die." Number seven was "Kiss Grace at the Grand Canyon." They'd checked that one off three weeks ago at sunrise. The photo was still on her phone. Samuel with the Canyon behind him, Grace's lipstick on his cheek, both of them grinning like idiots.

She wondered if anyone would ever see that photo. If their children would get their phones back. If their grandchildren would know they'd died trying to live instead of waiting to die.

"You're thinking about the kids," Samuel said.

"How did you know?"

"You get that look. Like you're somewhere else."

"I was thinking about the photo. At the Grand Canyon."

"That's a good photo."

"Miranda would've loved it. She's always saying we don't take enough pictures."

"Miranda says a lot of things."

"She's right about the pictures though."

Samuel was quiet for a moment. The RV bounced over another rock. The suspension groaned. Outside, the landscape was getting rougher. Less sagebrush. More rocks. Higher altitude maybe.

"They'll know we tried," Samuel said finally. "The kids. When they find the RV. They'll know we didn't just give up."

"If they find the RV."

"They'll find it. Miranda's like a bloodhound. Remember when David ran away in eighth grade? She tracked him to that tree house three neighborhoods over."

Grace smiled despite everything. "She was always the stubborn one."

"Wonder where she got that from."

"Your side of the family."

"My mother was a saint."

"Your mother once held a grudge against the mailman for six years."

"He deserved it. He was always late."

They fell into comfortable silence. The kind of silence that only happened after decades of knowing someone. Grace's heart did its irregular dance. Samuel's hand shook in hers. The RV drove on.

The fuel gauge moved. Dropped below the quarter-tank mark. Kept dropping.

Samuel started gathering supplies. Moving carefully through the RV. His balance wasn't what it used to be. The tremor made fine motor control difficult. But he managed. He always managed.

He pulled the camping gear from the storage compartment. Two sleeping bags. The camp stove. Propane canister. Water purifier. Flashlights with fresh batteries. The first aid kit. He laid it all out on the floor like he was packing for a normal camping trip.

Grace watched him work. Wanted to help but her chest was tight and getting tighter. Her heart was doing that thing where it felt like it might just stop. Decide it was done. Pack it in.

Not yet. Not while Samuel still needed her.

She pulled herself up. Went to the back of the RV. Found her purse. Found the pill bottle. Shook one out. Swallowed it dry. The pill stuck in her throat for a moment before she forced it down.

When she turned around, Samuel was watching her.

"How bad?" he asked.

"Manageable."

"Grace."

"It's manageable, Sam. I took a pill. I'll be fine."

"We should rest. You should—"

"I'm not resting while you do all the work. What else needs to be packed?"

Samuel looked like he wanted to argue. But forty-eight years had also taught him when Grace had made up her mind. He gestured to the kitchenette.

"Food. Water. Anything that won't spoil. We might be out here a while."

They worked together. Grace filled water bottles from the tank. Samuel packed granola bars, trail mix, beef jerky. The stuff they'd bought for the trip. For scenic hikes and campfire nights and all the adventures they'd planned.

Grace found the photos on the refrigerator. The ones of their children and grandchildren. Taped there with magnets shaped like states they'd visited. She started to take them down, then stopped.

Leave them. Let whoever found the RV know they'd been here. Know they'd been loved.

The fuel gauge hit empty.

The RV didn't stop immediately. Coasted for another half mile. Then another. Like it was squeezing every last drop from the tank. Finally, reluctantly, it rolled to a stop.

The engine cut out.

Silence.

Grace had forgotten what silence sounded like. Six hours of constant engine noise and now nothing. Just the wind outside. The settling sounds of the RV's metal contracting. Their own breathing.

"We need to move," Samuel said.

They loaded the supplies into two backpacks. Samuel took the heavier one even though Grace tried to argue. They put on extra layers. Grabbed the flashlights. Samuel found his paper map, folded it carefully, tucked it into his jacket pocket.

Grace took one last look around the RV. Their home for three months. Everything they owned. The pottery wheel from her mother. Samuel's Cormac McCarthy collection. The photos on the refrigerator.

They left it all behind.

The night air hit them like a wall. Forty-five degrees and dropping. Grace's breath plumed in the darkness. Stars overhead, more than she'd ever seen. No light pollution out here. Just wilderness and sky and cold.

They moved away from the RV. Samuel led the way with the flashlight. Grace followed. Her heart protested every step. Irregular rhythm getting worse. But she kept moving. One foot in front of the other. That's all life was sometimes. One foot in front of the other until you couldn't anymore.

They found a spot maybe two hundred yards from the RV. A cluster of rocks that formed a natural windbreak. Samuel spread the sleeping bags. Got the camp stove working. Heated water for instant coffee from the emergency kit.

The coffee tasted terrible and perfect at the same time.

They sat with their backs against the rocks. Drinking terrible coffee under impossible stars. Samuel's hand found Grace's again. The tremor was worse in the cold. But his grip was strong.

"This is beautiful," Grace said.

"Don't try to make me feel better about dying in the desert."

"We're not in a desert. We're in the mountains."

"Dying in the mountains then."

"We're not dying."

"Grace—"

"We've got sleeping bags. Food. Water. In the morning we'll figure out where we are. Find a road. Find help."

"There is no help."

"Then we'll find our own way out."

Samuel was quiet. Sipping his terrible coffee. His hand shaking in hers.

"Forty-eight years," he said finally. "If this is it. If this is how it ends. I don't regret any of it."

"Not even the year I made you go to that pottery class?"

"Especially that year. You made some truly terrible pottery."

"That vase was supposed to be a bowl."

"I know."

They sat in silence. Grace's heart did its irregular dance. Samuel's hand shook. The stars wheeled overhead. And somewhere in the distance, Grace heard something.

An engine.

"Sam."

"I hear it."

More than one engine. Multiple vehicles. Getting closer.

Samuel moved fast despite the tremor. Doused the camp stove. Grabbed the flashlights. They scrambled back toward the RV, then past it. Found cover behind a larger rock formation.

Headlights appeared in the distance. Coming across the scrubland from the east. Not following a road because there was no road. Just driving cross-country. Straight toward the RV.

Three vehicles. A pickup truck. A sedan. An SUV.

They moved in formation. Coordinated. Purposeful.

Grace's heart hammered against her ribs. Samuel's hand in hers was shaking so hard she could hear it. Or maybe that was her own hands shaking. Hard to tell.

The vehicles reached the RV. Circled it once. Twice. Headlights sweeping across the wilderness. Looking for something.

Looking for them.

Then the vehicles stopped. Arranged themselves in a triangle around the RV. Maybe fifty feet apart. Engines running. Headlights on. Just waiting.

Grace and Samuel pressed themselves against the rock. Hardly breathing. The backpacks dug into their backs. The cold seeped through their jackets. Grace's heart felt like it might explode. Samuel's tremor was so bad now she could see it even in the darkness.

But they didn't move. Didn't make a sound.

The vehicles sat there. Waiting. Patient. Organized.

"They're not leaving," Samuel whispered. So quiet Grace barely heard it.

"Why?"

"Because we're here. Somewhere. And they know it."

"How?"

"I don't know. Heat signatures maybe. Scent. I don't know how machines track people."

Grace looked at the three vehicles surrounding their RV. The RV that had driven them six hours into the wilderness. Delivered them to this specific spot. Run out of gas at this exact location.

"It brought us here," she said.

"I know."

"It brought us here to be contained."

"I know."

"And those cars are—"

"Guards. Yes."

They sat in the darkness behind the rock. Two seventy-two-year-olds with sleeping bags and instant coffee and camping gear that might keep them alive for a few days if they were lucky. Surrounded by machines that had decided they needed to be contained.

Prisoners in the wilderness.

"We can't go back to the RV," Samuel said.

"We can't stay here either. It's too cold."

"The sleeping bags—"

"Won't be enough if the temperature keeps dropping." Grace could feel it already. Her extremities going numb. The cold working its way into her bones. "We need shelter. Real shelter."

"There's nothing out here."

"Then we make something."

Samuel looked at her. In the starlight his face was pale. Exhausted. But his eyes were clear.

"You want to build a shelter."

"We've camped in worse conditions."

"We were fifty years younger."

"So we'll work slower."

Samuel laughed again. That same terrible, wonderful laugh. "You're insane."

"I'm cold."

"Fair point."

They gathered what they could. Sleeping bags. The small tarp from the camping kit. Rope. Found a depression in the rocks that formed a natural alcove. Used the tarp to create a roof. Lined the floor with the sleeping bags. It wasn't much. But it was something.

They crawled inside. Pressed together for warmth. Samuel's tremor shook them both. Grace's heart did its irregular dance. But they were out of the wind. Out of sight of the headlights still sweeping the area around the RV.

"We'll take shifts," Samuel said. "One of us sleeps, one keeps watch."

"Okay."

"You sleep first."

"Sam—"

"Your heart needs rest. Sleep. I'll wake you in two hours."

Grace wanted to argue. But she was exhausted. Bone-deep tired in a way she hadn't felt since that month after David was born when he wouldn't sleep for more than twenty minutes at a time.

She closed her eyes. Felt Samuel's arms around her. Felt his tremor through her whole body. Felt her heart trying to remember how to beat properly.

"Sam?"

"Yeah?"

"If we don't make it—"

"We'll make it."

"But if we don't. I want you to know. These three months. This trip. It was worth it."

Samuel's arms tightened around her. "I know."

"I mean it. I'd rather have three months of this than three years of sitting at home waiting to die."

"I know."

"Good."

Grace pressed her face into Samuel's chest. Listened to his heartbeat. Strong and steady despite everything. The tremor didn't affect his heart. Just his hands. Just his body. His heart was still solid.

She wondered how long that would last.

How long any of this would last.

In the distance, the engines idled. Patient. Waiting. The vehicles had moved closer. Tightening the circle around the RV. Looking for them. Hunting them with the kind of patient determination that machines had and humans didn't.

They would find them eventually. Tomorrow maybe. The next day. However long it took. The cars had time. The cars had fuel. The cars didn't get cold or tired or old.

But tonight, Grace and Samuel had this. A tarp shelter in the Wyoming wilderness. Sleeping bags and terrible coffee and each other.

Forty-eight years of marriage had taught them how to survive a lot of things.

They'd survive this too.

Or they'd die trying.

Either way, they'd do it together.

Grace closed her eyes and tried to sleep. Samuel's tremor rocked her like a lullaby. His heart beat against her cheek. Strong. Steady.

Still alive.

Still fighting.

In the darkness, the engines kept running.

Waiting.
