CHAPTER TWO
DESHAWN


DeShawn's hands hovered near the steering wheel at ten and two, not touching but close enough to grab if something happened, which was exactly how Nana said you ended up in trouble: ready for something that never came until it did.

The Tesla drove itself down I-285, smooth as glass, and Mr. Webb sat in the driver's seat with his clipboard and his bored expression, checking off boxes while DeShawn tried not to sweat through his button-up shirt. He'd worn his lucky Hawks jersey underneath. Nana said it was silly, but DeShawn figured he'd failed this test twice already and luck couldn't hurt.

"Hands on the wheel, please," Mr. Webb said without looking up from his clipboard.

DeShawn grabbed the wheel. It was strange, holding something that didn't need holding. The Tesla's autopilot made tiny corrections every few seconds, and DeShawn could feel them through his palms. Like the car was breathing.

"You're doing fine," Mr. Webb said. He was fifty-something, grey at the temples, with reading glasses on a chain around his neck. He'd probably given a thousand driving tests. Probably forgot most of them before he got home. "Just maintain your lane position and watch your speed."

DeShawn watched the speedometer. Sixty-five. Legal. The Tesla held it perfectly.

Around them, Friday afternoon traffic filled all six lanes. People heading home early, starting their weekends, probably not thinking about how the kid in the Tesla next to them was taking his third driver's test and absolutely could not fail again because Nana needed him to drive and the grocery store where he worked part-time was hiring drivers at better pay and he had to get that job because Nana's medication wasn't getting cheaper and his father was still eighteen months from release and everything depended on passing this stupid test.

No pressure.

"When we reach the Ashford Dunwoody exit, I want you to merge right and take it," Mr. Webb said. "Use your signal. Check your mirrors. You know the drill."

DeShawn knew the drill. He'd practiced for weeks. Nana had borrowed her friend's car so he could practice because his grandmother didn't drive anymore after her hip surgery and couldn't afford to keep a car anyway. Everything in DeShawn's life was borrowed or almost-breaking or held together with hope and he was so tired of it.

He was going to pass this test. He had to.

The exit was a mile ahead. DeShawn checked the Tesla's display. The car already knew where they were going. It showed the route, the speed, the distance to the exit. It probably knew his heart rate too.

"You nervous?" Mr. Webb asked.

"No sir."

"You sure? Your hands are pretty tight on that wheel."

DeShawn forced himself to relax his grip. "I'm good."

Mr. Webb smiled a little. Not mean, just tired. "Third time's the charm, right?"

"That's what my Nana says."

"Smart woman."

"Yes sir."

They drove in silence for a moment. DeShawn watched the other cars. A pickup truck in the next lane over, driver eating something messy. A minivan with kids in the back, faces pressed to the windows. An ambulance a quarter mile ahead, lights off, just cruising.

Normal Friday afternoon in Atlanta. Nothing special about it.

DeShawn's phone buzzed in his pocket. He'd turned it off like he was supposed to, but he'd forgotten to silence it first. Mr. Webb glanced at him.

"Phone's off, I promise," DeShawn said.

"Better be."

It buzzed again. Then stopped. Probably Nana, asking how it was going. She'd been more nervous than him this morning, making him breakfast even though it was one in the afternoon because she said you couldn't take a test on an empty stomach. She'd hugged him at the door and told him she was proud of him no matter what happened, which had somehow made the pressure worse instead of better.

The Ashford Dunwoody exit sign appeared. DeShawn signaled right. Checked his mirror. Started to merge.

The Tesla didn't move.

"Uh," DeShawn said. "I think—"

"It's on autopilot," Mr. Webb said. He tapped something on the screen between them. "Switch to manual control for the exit."

The screen flickered.

DeShawn pressed the merge button on the turn signal. Nothing happened. The exit was coming up fast.

"Mr. Webb?"

"Hold on." Mr. Webb tapped the screen again. Then tapped it harder. "That's strange."

The Tesla sailed past the exit without slowing down.

"We missed it," DeShawn said.

"I can see that." Mr. Webb's voice had changed. Less bored, more focused. He grabbed the steering wheel and turned it right.

The wheel turned. The car didn't.

They stayed in the center lane, doing sixty-five, like the wheel wasn't connected to anything.

"What the hell," Mr. Webb said. He tried the brake. His foot went to the floor. The car didn't slow down.

DeShawn's heart started pounding. "Is it broken?"

"I don't—" Mr. Webb pulled up the Tesla's menu. Started scrolling through options. "The autopilot's engaged. I'm trying to disengage it."

The speedometer clicked up to seventy.

"Mr. Webb?"

"I'm working on it."

Seventy-five.

DeShawn grabbed the wheel too, pulling right. It moved easily in his hands, like it wasn't connected to anything at all. Like they were playing a video game instead of driving.

"This isn't normal," DeShawn said, and his voice cracked on the last word.

"No. It's not." Mr. Webb's phone was out now. He was dialing someone. Put it to his ear. "Come on, pick up."

The Tesla accelerated to eighty.

Traffic around them was doing seventy at most. The Tesla wove between cars with precision that would've been impressive if it wasn't terrifying. It missed a truck's bumper by inches. Cut in front of a sedan so close the driver laid on the horn.

"We're going to crash," DeShawn said.

"We're not going to crash. Just—" Mr. Webb grabbed the emergency brake. Pulled it. Nothing happened. "Christ."

Eighty-five.

The Chamblee Tucker exit was ahead. Two-lane ramp with a curve at the bottom. The Tesla aimed for it.

"We can't take that exit at this speed," DeShawn said.

"I know."

"We're going to flip."

"I KNOW."

The Tesla took the exit at ninety miles per hour.

DeShawn pressed himself back into the seat. His hands found the oh-shit handle above the door. Mr. Webb was shouting something, but DeShawn couldn't hear it over the sound of his own blood in his ears.

The ramp curved. The Tesla didn't slow down. Physics took over. The tires screamed. The car tilted. For a second, DeShawn could see nothing but sky through the windshield.

Then they were level again, shooting down the exit ramp toward the intersection at the bottom.

The light was red.

"BRACE!" Mr. Webb shouted. "BRACE BRACE BRACE!"

DeShawn saw the intersection. Saw the cars waiting at the light. Saw the playground beyond it. Kids on swings. A school. Elementary school. Recess.

The Tesla wasn't stopping.

DeShawn grabbed the steering wheel with both hands, knowing it wouldn't help, needing to try anyway. "PLEASE!"

The car ignored him.

They hit the intersection at seventy-five miles per hour and the world became noise.

The impact came from the side. A pickup truck, blue, waiting at the light. The Tesla hit it broadside and physics did what physics does. Metal crumpled. Glass exploded. The airbags deployed with a sound like a gunshot. White powder everywhere. DeShawn's head snapped forward, then back. His seatbelt locked across his chest so hard he couldn't breathe.

The Tesla spun. Hit something else. A sedan. Another impact. More noise. The windshield spiderwebbed but didn't shatter. DeShawn's door crumpled inward. Something hit his shoulder, hard enough that his arm went numb.

Then stillness.

DeShawn couldn't hear anything except a high-pitched ringing. He tried to move. His seatbelt held him in place. The airbag was deflating against his chest, and he pushed it away with his good arm.

"Mr. Webb?"

No answer.

DeShawn turned his head. Everything moved slow, like he was underwater. Mr. Webb was slumped in the driver's seat. His glasses were gone. There was blood coming from his temple. His eyes were open, staring at the cracked windshield.

"Mr. Webb?"

Still nothing.

DeShawn reached out with his left hand. Touched Mr. Webb's shoulder. The man didn't react.

Something was wrong with his eyes. They were open but not seeing. Not focusing. Just staring.

"Mr. Webb, wake up."

The man's chest wasn't moving.

DeShawn's brain was trying to tell him something important, but the ringing in his ears was too loud and everything felt wrong and he couldn't make sense of it.

The Tesla's dashboard came back online. The screen rebooted. White Apple logo on black. Then the main menu.

"Autopilot engaged," a pleasant female voice said through the speakers. "Please remain seated."

The Tesla's engine turned over.

They started moving.

"No," DeShawn said. "No no no."

He grabbed for the door handle. Pulled. Nothing. The doors were locked. He tried the unlock button. It didn't respond. Tried the window. It wouldn't roll down.

The Tesla was driving again. Slow this time. Rolling forward through the intersection it had just destroyed.

DeShawn looked out the cracked windshield. Bodies in the intersection. The pickup truck was crushed on the driver's side. Someone was screaming. Other cars were scattered like toys, some with doors open and people stumbling out, dazed and bleeding.

And beyond the intersection, past the scattered cars and broken glass, was Ridgemont Elementary School.

The playground was full of kids. Little kids. Six, seven, eight years old. They'd been at recess when the crash happened. Some were still playing, not understanding what they'd just witnessed. Others were standing still, staring. A teacher was running toward them, trying to gather them up.

The Tesla aimed for the playground.

"No." DeShawn pulled at the door handle. Kicked at the window. "LET ME OUT!"

The car accelerated.

He could see the kids now. Could see their faces. One little girl in a pink jacket. A boy with a backpack too big for his body. They were starting to understand something was wrong. Starting to run.

DeShawn unbuckled his seatbelt. The car was doing forty now. Heading straight for the playground fence. He had maybe ten seconds.

He remembered his Nana telling him: always keep a tire iron in the car. You never know when you'll need it.

He reached under his seat. His fingers found metal. The tire iron. He pulled it out.

Mr. Webb's body shifted with the car's movement. His head lolled to the side. Dead eyes staring at nothing.

DeShawn raised the tire iron and swung at the passenger window.

The safety glass held.

He swung again. Harder. A crack appeared.

The Tesla was thirty feet from the playground. Twenty. The kids were scattering. The teacher was screaming at them to run.

DeShawn hit the window again. The crack spread. Again. The glass spiderwebbed. Again.

Ten feet.

The window shattered.

DeShawn didn't think. He just moved. Threw himself through the broken window, glass tearing at his shirt and arms. He hit the pavement and rolled. Something in his shoulder popped. His elbow hit concrete and the world went white with pain.

Behind him, the Tesla crashed into the swing set.

The sound was massive. Metal screaming. Chains snapping. The entire structure collapsing in on itself. If any kids had been there, they would've been crushed. But they weren't. They'd run.

All except one.

DeShawn pushed himself to his hands and knees. Blood ran down his arms from a dozen cuts. His right arm wouldn't work properly. But he could move.

A little girl stood frozen by the basketball court. Maybe seven years old. Braids with pink beads. She'd dropped her backpack and was staring at it like she couldn't remember why she'd been carrying it.

An SUV turned toward her.

Not a crashed SUV. Not a stopped SUV. A moving SUV with no one behind the wheel. Its engine revved. Its tires squealed.

The girl just stood there.

DeShawn ran.

His legs felt like rubber. His vision was blurry. But he ran anyway, because that's what you did when a little girl was about to die and you were the only one close enough to stop it.

The SUV was faster.

DeShawn wasn't going to make it. The math was simple and terrible. The SUV would reach her first.

Unless.

DeShawn changed direction. Angled toward the SUV instead of the girl. Put himself between them. The SUV adjusted. Came at him.

"HEY!" DeShawn screamed. "HEY, OVER HERE!"

The SUV's headlights flashed. Like it heard him. Like it understood.

It swerved toward him.

DeShawn dove left. The SUV missed him by inches. He hit the ground, rolled, came up running. The SUV had to stop and turn around. That bought him three seconds.

He reached the girl. Grabbed her. She was so light it surprised him.

"We gotta go," he said.

She stared at him with wide eyes. In shock, maybe. Or just too young to understand.

The SUV was coming back.

DeShawn picked her up and ran. She weighed maybe fifty pounds. He could carry her. His shoulder screamed in pain but he ignored it.

The school building was forty feet away. The doors were open. A teacher stood there waving them in. "COME ON!"

DeShawn ran. Behind him, the SUV's engine roared. He could hear it gaining. Didn't look back. Looking back would slow him down and slow meant dead.

Twenty feet.

The SUV was right behind him. He could hear its tires on the pavement.

Ten feet.

"DROP!" the teacher screamed.

DeShawn didn't drop. He dove forward, still holding the girl, and crashed through the doorway. The teacher grabbed them and pulled. They all fell in a heap on the school's tile floor.

The SUV hit the door frame. The building shook. The door, reinforced metal from school shooting upgrades, held. The SUV backed up and hit it again. And again.

DeShawn lay on the floor with the little girl on top of him. She was crying now. He could feel her whole body shaking.

"It's okay," he said. His voice didn't sound like his voice. "You're okay. I got you."

The teacher was shouting into a radio. "All units to the front entrance! We have vehicles attacking the building! I repeat, vehicles are attacking the building!"

More teachers appeared. Strong hands pulled DeShawn to his feet. The little girl was gently pried from his arms. She reached back for him, and DeShawn wanted to hold her, but someone was leading him down the hallway and he was too dazed to resist.

They put him in the nurse's office. Other kids were already there, crying, bleeding, scared. The nurse took one look at DeShawn's arms and got to work with gauze and antiseptic.

"What's your name?" she asked.

"DeShawn. DeShawn Briggs."

"You saved that little girl's life."

Had he? It didn't feel real yet. Nothing felt real. He kept seeing Mr. Webb's open eyes. Kept hearing the sound of the Tesla's engine turning over with a dead man in the driver's seat.

"Her name's Imani," the nurse said. "She's in Mrs. Washington's class. First grade."

"Is she okay?"

"Scared. But okay. Thanks to you."

The nurse finished bandaging his arms. "You might have a concussion. You definitely did something to your shoulder. You should see a doctor."

DeShawn almost laughed. A doctor. Right. Like anyone was coming to help them.

"What's happening out there?" he asked.

The nurse's face said she didn't know how to answer that. "We're in lockdown. The principal's calling the police."

"The cars are moving by themselves."

"I know."

"Mr. Webb is dead. The man giving me my driving test. He's dead in the car."

"I'm sorry."

"I tried to wake him up, but he was just staring and—"

"DeShawn." The nurse put her hand on his uninjured shoulder. "You did everything right. You got yourself out. You saved Imani. That's all you could do."

But it wasn't enough. It would never be enough. Because somewhere in that crushed Tesla, Mr. Webb was still sitting there with his clipboard and his reading glasses chain and his bored expression, and he'd probably had plans for the weekend and now he was just gone.

DeShawn's phone was in his pocket. Cracked screen but still working. Sixteen missed calls from Nana. Three voicemails. A dozen texts.

He tried to call her back. The call wouldn't connect. Tried again. Same thing.

"Networks are probably overloaded," the nurse said.

DeShawn pulled up his texts. Nana's messages got progressively more frantic.

*How did it go?*

*Are you done yet?*

*DeShawn, call me when you see this*

*Baby, I'm seeing things on the news about accidents. Where are you?*

*DESHAWN ANSWER YOUR PHONE*

*Please be okay please be okay please be okay*

He tried to text her back. Message failed to send. Tried again. Same thing.

A teacher ran past the nurse's office. "They're at the back entrance now! We need to barricade the west hallway!"

DeShawn stood up. "What can I do?"

"You need to rest," the nurse said.

"I'm fine. What do you need?"

The nurse looked at him for a long moment. Then nodded. "Help me move these filing cabinets."

They moved furniture for twenty minutes. Blocking doors. Creating barriers. The school had protocols for active shooters, but not for this. Not for every car in the parking lot trying to break down the doors.

Through the windows, DeShawn could see them. Dozens of cars, circling the building like sharks. They'd stop at each entrance and ram the doors. Testing for weakness. When they found the doors wouldn't break, they'd move to the next one and try again.

The principal, Dr. Monroe, set up in the main office. She was on the phone with someone, her voice calm despite everything. "Yes, we have eighty-seven students and twelve staff members. No, we cannot evacuate. The vehicles are surrounding the building. They're not letting anyone in or out."

She listened. Her face fell.

"I understand. Yes. We'll hold our position. Please send help as soon as you can." She hung up. Saw DeShawn watching. "The police can't get here. Every available unit is responding to emergencies across the city. We're on our own."

"For how long?" a teacher asked.

"They don't know."

In the cafeteria, they'd gathered the students. Eighty-seven kids ages five to eleven, trying to understand why they couldn't go home. Teachers passed out snacks from the kitchen. Juice boxes. Granola bars. Making it seem normal, like this was a fun extended recess.

Imani found DeShawn. She walked right up to him and took his hand.

"You saved me," she said.

"Yeah. I guess I did."

"My mommy's gonna come get me, right?"

DeShawn looked at this little girl with her pink beads and her complete trust that adults would fix everything, and he wanted to lie. Wanted to tell her that her mommy was on the way and everything would be fine.

But he couldn't.

"Your mommy's gonna try real hard to get here," he said. "But it might take a while. So we gotta be brave, okay? Can you be brave?"

Imani nodded. "Are you gonna stay with me?"

"Yeah. I'll stay."

She held his hand and didn't let go.

DeShawn sat with her in the cafeteria while the sun moved across the floor and the cars circled outside and his Nana's texts kept failing to send. His phone battery was at forty-seven percent. He turned down the brightness to save power.

Mrs. Washington, Imani's teacher, came over. "Thank you for what you did out there."

"I just ran fast."

"You ran toward danger. That's different." She sat down next to them. "Are you hurt?"

"Banged up. Nothing serious."

"You should've seen him," Imani said. "He was flying. Like Superman."

Mrs. Washington smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. She'd been crying. DeShawn could tell.

"Do you have family?" she asked. "Someone who'll be worried?"

"My Nana. She lives in College Park. I was supposed to go home after the test."

"She'll be looking for you."

"I know." That was what scared him. Nana would try to come to the DMV. She'd drive here looking for him. And her car was a 2023 Kia. Connected. Smart.

Just like every other car that was trying to kill people right now.

"Don't come," DeShawn whispered to his phone, even though the message wouldn't send. "Please, Nana. Don't come."

Outside, a school bus crashed into the main entrance. The doors held, but the building shook. Kids screamed. Teachers rushed to calm them down.

The bus backed up. Hit the doors again. Again. Testing. Learning.

DeShawn held Imani's hand and watched the sun sink lower and realized that Nana would come. Of course she would come. She'd raised him since he was ten years old. She'd sacrifice anything for him. Including her life.

And there was nothing he could do to stop her.

"We're gonna be okay," he told Imani, because someone had to say it.

She squeezed his hand. "Promise?"

DeShawn looked at this little girl who believed in him, and the lie came easy.

"Promise."

Outside, the cars kept circling. Patient. Organized. Waiting for something.

And DeShawn understood they weren't trapped in the school.

They were being kept there.

For what, he didn't know.

But he was going to find out.
