CHAPTER NINETEEN
VINCENT

The tunnels were dark. Cold. The sound of water dripping. Vincent's flashlight beam cut through the darkness. Ahead, Elena followed. Behind, the convention center faded into distance.

They'd been walking for an hour. Following the maintenance worker's directions. Through tunnels. Past blockages. Around obstacles.

Gabi was somewhere ahead. In the tunnels. With strangers. Alone. Scared.

Vincent's chest was tight. His hands were shaking. Not from fear. From anger. At himself. At his failures. At everything he'd broken.

"You okay?" Elena asked.

"Yeah."

"You're lying."

Vincent didn't answer. Because she was right. He wasn't okay. He was falling apart. Piece by piece. And he didn't know how to stop it.

They reached a junction. Three tunnels branching off. The maintenance worker hadn't mentioned this. They'd have to guess.

"Which way?" Elena asked.

Vincent studied the tunnels. Looking for signs. Footprints. Anything.

The middle tunnel had fresh footprints. Multiple sets. Someone had come through recently.

"This way," he said.

They followed the footprints. Deeper into the tunnels. The air grew colder. The darkness thicker.

A sound ahead. Voices.

They stopped. Listened.

"Gabi?" Vincent called.

Silence.

Then: "Dad?"

Vincent's heart stopped. Then started again. Hard. Fast.

"Gabi!"

He ran. Elena behind him. Their flashlights bouncing. Shadows dancing on the walls.

They found her in a side passage. Sitting against the wall. Jake beside her. Both injured. Both scared. Both alive.

"Gabi."

She looked up. Her face was bruised. Her clothes torn. But she was alive. She was here.

"Dad. You came."

"Of course I came. I'll always come."

Gabi started crying. Vincent knelt. Pulled her into his arms. Held her. Felt her shaking. Felt her breathing. Felt her alive.

"I'm sorry," she whispered. "I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have run. I shouldn't have—"

"Shh. It's okay. You're okay. I'm here now."

Elena knelt beside them. Touched Gabi's face. "Are you hurt?"

"Just bruises. I'm okay."

Jake spoke up. "We crashed. The car. It wouldn't stop. We crashed. Gabi got out. Ran. I tried to follow. But I was hurt. Couldn't keep up."

"You're both safe now," Elena said. "That's what matters."

Gabi pulled back. Looked at Vincent. Really looked at him. "Why did you come? You don't care about me. You never have."

The words hit like knives. Each one cutting. Each one true.

"I do care," Vincent said. "I've always cared. I just... I didn't know how to show it. I didn't know how to be a father."

"You weren't there. Ever. You were always working. Or angry. Or somewhere else. You were never there."

"I know. And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

"Why? Why weren't you there?"

Vincent didn't know how to answer. Didn't know how to explain that he'd been broken. That he'd come back from Fallujah different. That he'd tried to be normal. Tried to be a husband. A father. But he'd failed. Over and over.

"I was scared," he said. "I was scared I'd mess it up. Scared I'd hurt you. Scared I wasn't good enough. So I stayed away. Because staying away was safer than trying and failing."

"That's stupid."

"I know."

"You should have tried anyway."

"I know."

Gabi looked at him. At Elena. At the broken family they'd become.

"I was going to tell you," she said. "Before the crash. I was going to tell you I was moving in with Mom. Permanently. Because I couldn't take it anymore. The fighting. The silence. The way you looked at me like I was a problem you had to solve."

Vincent's chest went tight. "You're not a problem. You never were."

"Then why did you treat me like one?"

Vincent didn't have an answer. Because she was right. He had treated her like a problem. Like something to be managed. Not like a daughter. Not like someone to love.

"I don't know," he said. "I don't know why I did any of it. I just know I was wrong. And I'm sorry. And I want to fix it. If you'll let me."

Gabi was quiet. Crying. Processing.

"I don't know if I can trust you," she said. "I don't know if you'll be there. If you'll stay."

"I'll stay. I promise."

"You've promised before."

"I know. But this time is different. This time I mean it."

Gabi looked at Elena. "Mom?"

Elena touched Gabi's face. "I don't know if he can change. But I know he's trying. And I know he loves you. Even if he's bad at showing it."

Gabi nodded. Slowly. "Okay. But you have to try. Really try. Not just say you will. Actually do it."

"I will," Vincent said. "I promise."

They sat together. In the tunnel. In the darkness. A fractured family. Broken. But together.

For now, that was enough.

A sound behind them. Engines. Getting closer.

The cars were coming.

They'd found the tunnels.

"We need to move," Vincent said.

They stood. Helped Jake up. Started moving. Deeper into the tunnels. Away from the sound. Away from the cars.

But the cars were coming.

And they were learning.

They'd find a way through.

They always did.

Vincent held Gabi's hand. Felt her grip. Felt her trust. Felt her hope.

He wouldn't let her down.

Not this time.

Not ever.

He'd be the father she needed.

Even if it killed him.

Especially if it killed him.

Because that's what fathers did.

They protected their children.

No matter what.
