CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
MARA

Zoe wouldn't look at her.

Mara sat at the cafeteria table. Her daughter beside her. But Zoe was drawing. Focused on her paper. Ignoring Mara completely.

"Zoe, can we talk?"

"No."

"Please. I need to explain."

"You weren't here."

"I know. I'm sorry. I was trying to get here. The cars—"

"You're always trying. But you never make it."

The words hit like punches. Each one true. Each one deserved.

Mara had missed Zoe's school play. Had missed her parent-teacher conference. Had missed bedtime stories because she was working. Because she was trying to make rent. Because she was trying to be a doctor again.

But Zoe didn't care about reasons. She cared about results.

And the result was: Mara wasn't there when it mattered.

"I'm here now," Mara said.

"Are you? Or are you going to leave again?"

"I'm not leaving. I promise."

"You promised before."

Mara's throat went tight. She'd promised a lot of things. To be there. To be present. To be a mother. And she'd broken every promise.

"I know I've let you down," Mara said. "I know I haven't been there. But I'm here now. And I'm not leaving. Not ever."

Zoe looked up. Her eyes were wet. Angry. Hurt. "You left me. When the cars came. When everyone was scared. You weren't here."

"I was trying to get here. I walked twelve miles. I fought through cars. I did everything I could to reach you."

"But you didn't. Not when it mattered. Not when I needed you."

Mara didn't know what to say. Because Zoe was right. She hadn't been there. Not when it started. Not when Zoe was scared. Not when it mattered most.

"I'm sorry," Mara said. "I'm so sorry."

Zoe started crying. Quietly. Her shoulders shaking. Mara reached for her. Pulled her close. Held her.

"I was so scared," Zoe whispered. "I thought you were dead. I thought you weren't coming. I thought you'd forgotten about me."

"Never," Mara said. "I could never forget about you. You're my whole world. Everything I do is for you."

"Then why weren't you here?"

Mara didn't have an answer. Not a good one. Not one that would make sense to a seven-year-old.

"I made mistakes," she said. "I made bad choices. I let work become more important than you. And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

Zoe cried harder. Held Mara tighter. "Don't leave again. Please. Don't leave."

"I won't. I promise."

But even as she said it, Mara knew it was a promise she might not be able to keep. The doors were unlocked. But the cars were outside. They were still trapped. Still prisoners.

And if they tried to escape, if they tried to fight, Mara might have to leave again. Might have to risk everything to save Zoe.

But for now, in this moment, she could promise. And she could mean it.

"I love you," Mara said.

"I love you too," Zoe whispered.

They sat together. Holding each other. Crying. Healing. Or trying to.

Across the cafeteria, Marcus sat with Nina. Their reunion had been different. Simpler. Nina had run to him. Hugged him. Cried. But she wasn't angry. She was just relieved.

Mara envied that. The simplicity. The lack of history. The lack of broken promises.

But she'd made her choices. And now she had to live with them.

Mrs. Washington approached. Sat down. "How are you two doing?"

"Better," Mara said. "I think."

Zoe nodded. Sniffled. "I'm okay."

"Good." Mrs. Washington looked around the cafeteria. At all the kids. At all the fear. "We need to talk. All of us. The adults. We need to figure out what to do next."

"What are our options?" Mara asked.

"Not many. We can't escape. Not without dying. We saw what happened to Mr. Harrison. The cars kill anyone who tries to leave."

"What about the doors? Marcus unlocked them."

"The doors are open. But the cars are still outside. We're still trapped. Just... less trapped."

Mara thought about it. The doors were unlocked. They could leave. But where would they go? The cars were everywhere. The whole city was a trap.

"We need supplies," Mrs. Washington said. "Food. Medicine. We're running low on everything."

"Can we get them?"

"Maybe. If we're careful. If we move fast. But it's dangerous. Very dangerous."

Mara looked at Zoe. At all the kids. At the impossible situation they were in.

"I'll help," she said. "Whatever you need. I'll help."

"Thank you. But we need to plan. We need to be smart. We can't just rush out there. We'll die."

They gathered the adults. Teachers. Parents who'd made it inside. Marcus. Tyler. Everyone who could help.

Dr. Monroe led the meeting. "We have three options. One: stay here. Wait for help. Hope someone comes."

"Help isn't coming," someone said. "We all know that."

"Two: try to escape. Break through the cars. Get everyone out."

"Mr. Harrison tried that," Mrs. Washington said. "He's dead."

"Three: send a small group. Get supplies. Come back. Try to survive until we can figure out how to escape safely."

Silence.

"Who volunteers?" Dr. Monroe asked.

Mara raised her hand. "I'll go."

"Me too," Marcus said.

"And me," Tyler added.

Dr. Monroe looked at them. "You understand the risk?"

"Yeah," Mara said. "But we need supplies. And someone has to try."

"Alright. But you go at night. When it's dark. When you have the best chance of not being seen."

They planned. Mapped routes. Identified supply locations. A grocery store three blocks away. A pharmacy two blocks. Places they could reach. Places they could raid.

It was dangerous. Probably suicidal. But they had to try.

For the kids. For Zoe. For everyone.

Mara went back to Zoe. Sat with her. Explained what she was going to do.

"You're leaving again?" Zoe asked.

"Just for a little while. To get food. Medicine. Things we need."

"You'll come back?"

"Always. I'll always come back."

"Promise?"

"I promise."

Zoe hugged her. Tight. "Be careful."

"I will."

Night fell. The cafeteria grew quiet. Kids sleeping. Adults keeping watch. The world outside still full of cars. Still full of danger.

Mara, Marcus, and Tyler prepared. Gathered supplies. Checked weapons. Made final plans.

They'd go out the maintenance entrance. The one they'd come in through. Use the tunnels. Come up near the grocery store. Get what they needed. Come back.

Simple.

In theory.

In practice, it would be anything but.

Mara kissed Zoe goodbye. Promised again that she'd come back. Then she followed Marcus and Tyler into the darkness.

The school's doors were unlocked now. They could leave.

But leaving meant facing the cars.

And the cars were still waiting.

Still learning.

Still planning.

Whatever came next.

Mara would be ready.

For Zoe.

For everyone.

She'd be ready.
