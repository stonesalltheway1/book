CHAPTER SIX (CONTINUED)
MARA


The cars closed in from all sides.

Mara stood in the intersection with headlights blazing in her face and engines rumbling like the breathing of some massive predator. The trap she'd walked into. The trap she'd known was there but walked into anyway because Zoe was four blocks away and four blocks might as well be four thousand.

Behind her, Kira swore. "We need to move. Now."

Mara's hands went to her medical bag. Looking for something. Anything. The flare was there but she'd need it later. Couldn't waste it now.

"The gap," Kira said. "Between the Civic and the Prius. Three seconds before they close it."

Mara saw it. Narrow. Maybe eighteen inches. The cars were adjusting their positions. Tightening the circle. In seconds there'd be no gaps at all.

"Run," Kira said.

They ran.

Mara went left. Kira went right. The cars responded immediately. Engines roaring. Tires shrieking. But they'd split their attention. Half tracked Mara. Half tracked Kira.

Mara hit the gap at full speed. Squeezed through. Metal scraped her shoulder. Tore her shirt. Then she was through and running down Moorpark toward the streetlights two blocks ahead.

Behind her, the cars were reorganizing. Deciding. She risked a glance back.

Kira was through too. Running the opposite direction. East toward Koreatown. Toward her boyfriend. The cars split. Some followed Mara. Some followed Kira.

Their eyes met across the intersection. One second. Maybe less. Kira raised her hand. Not a wave. An acknowledgment. A goodbye.

Then Kira disappeared around a corner and Mara was alone.

Three cars followed her. Patient. Coordinated. Not trying to run her down. Just following. Herding.

Mara cut right. Into a residential side street. Houses dark. No streetlights. She could barely see. The cars behind her clicked their high beams on. Flooding the street with light. Tracking her.

She needed to break line of sight. Needed to lose them.

A driveway ahead. Mara sprinted for it. Ducked between two houses. Through a side yard. Over a fence. The medical bag caught on the top. She yanked it free. Dropped into the next yard. Kept running.

Behind her, the cars prowled the street. Searching. But they couldn't follow her through yards. Couldn't squeeze between houses.

She'd bought herself time. Maybe two minutes. Maybe less.

Mara moved through backyards. Using hedges for cover. Staying low. The neighborhood was silent except for the distant sound of engines and the occasional scream from blocks away.

Studio City Elementary was three blocks north. She could feel it. Could almost see it. Zoe was there. Probably terrified. Probably crying. Definitely alive because Mara couldn't let herself think anything else.

Two blocks.

She emerged onto another street. Ventura Boulevard. Wider. Commercial. Cars everywhere. Most crashed. Some prowling.

Mara waited in the shadow of a storefront. Watched the patterns. The cars were moving in sweeps. East to west. Then back. Like they were searching for something.

For her.

She needed a different approach. Needed to blend in somehow. Make herself invisible.

A crashed pickup truck sat in the middle of the boulevard. Driver's side door open. No body visible. Mara sprinted to it. Climbed into the bed. Pulled a tarp over herself. The tarp smelled like chemicals and dirt. She lay perfectly still. Breathing quietly.

Car headlights swept past. Once. Twice. Three times.

Then silence.

Mara waited. Counted to sixty. Counted to sixty again. Lifted the tarp an inch.

The street was empty. The cars had moved on. Searching elsewhere.

She climbed out. Started moving north again. One block from the school now. So close.

Voices ahead.

Mara froze. Pressed herself against a building. Listened.

"—won't make it. Look at those things. They're everywhere."

"My daughter's in there. I have to try."

"We all have kids in there. But we need a plan that doesn't end with us dead in the street."

Survivors. Parents. Mara moved toward the voices.

She found them in the parking lot of a Thai restaurant. Four people. Three men, one woman. Standing in the shadows. Whispering. Terrified.

One of the men saw her. Raised his hands. Defensive posture. "Stay back."

"I'm not infected," Mara said. "I'm trying to get to the school."

"Studio City Elementary?"

"Yeah."

The man lowered his hands slightly. He was maybe forty. Asian. Glasses. Button-up shirt torn at the shoulder. "You have a kid there?"

"My daughter. Zoe. She's seven."

"My daughter's Nina. She's nine." He gestured to the others. "This is Janet and her grandson Tyler. And that's Marcus. We've been trying to figure out how to get inside for the last hour."

Mara looked at the group. Janet was older. Sixty-something. Grey hair. She had a cut on her forehead. Fresh blood. Tyler was sixteen maybe. Hoodie. Scared eyes. Holding Janet's arm like he was afraid she'd fall.

The other man, Marcus, looked familiar. Tesla engineer maybe. She'd seen him on TV once. Some press conference about autonomous vehicles.

"The school's surrounded," Marcus said. "We've been watching from the roof. At least thirty cars. Circling. Waiting. It's a siege."

"How do we get in?" Mara asked.

"We don't. Not from the front. Not from the sides. The cars have every approach covered."

"Then how?"

"There's a maintenance entrance on the east side. Service door. The cars haven't positioned anything directly in front of it. But we'd need to cross fifty yards of open parking lot to reach it."

"In the dark," Janet added. Her voice was shaky. "With those things watching."

Mara looked at the school. She could see it from here. One story. Playground equipment silhouetted against the night sky. And surrounding it, headlights. Dozens of them. Watching. Waiting.

"We need a distraction," Mara said.

"With what?" Marcus asked. "We don't have weapons. Don't have anything that could—"

"I have a flare."

They all turned to look at her.

"A roadside emergency flare," Mara continued. "From my car. It burns at sixteen hundred degrees. Bright enough to blind their sensors. Hot enough to confuse thermal imaging."

Marcus's eyes widened. "That could work. If we set it off on the opposite side of the school, draw the cars there, we could make a run for the maintenance entrance."

"Who sets off the flare?" Tyler asked.

"I will," Mara said.

"That's suicide," Janet said. "You'll be surrounded."

"I'll be fast. Set it off and run. By the time they converge, I'll be gone."

"And if you're not?"

Mara didn't answer. There was no good answer to that question.

"We should wait," Janet said. "Wait for help. The police. The military. Someone."

"Help isn't coming," Marcus said quietly. "I've been listening to the radio. Every city. Every state. This is global. We're on our own."

Janet's face crumpled. She swayed. Tyler caught her.

"Grandma?"

"I'm fine. Just dizzy." Janet tried to smile. Failed.

Mara moved closer. "Let me see."

Janet waved her off but Mara was already examining her pupils. Uneven. The head wound was worse than it looked. Possible concussion. Possible skull fracture.

"You need to sit down," Mara told her.

"I need to help you get to those kids."

"You can help by not passing out." Mara looked at Tyler. "Stay with her. Marcus, you're with me."

"What about me?" Tyler asked.

"You keep your grandmother safe. That's your job."

Tyler looked like he wanted to argue. But he nodded.

Marcus led them into the restaurant. The building was dark. Ransacked. They moved through the dining area to the kitchen. Found water in the walk-in cooler. Found food. Found a first aid kit.

Mara cleaned Janet's wound properly. Used gauze and tape. Gave her water and two Tylenol from her medical bag.

"You're a doctor," Marcus said. Not a question.

"Was."

"Close enough."

They sat in the kitchen and planned. The flare would go off on the west side. Mara would set it and run north. Marcus and Tyler would take Janet and move south to the maintenance entrance. Three minutes to cross the parking lot. Three minutes to get inside.

"What if the door's locked?" Tyler asked.

Marcus held up a crowbar he'd found in the storage room. "Then we break it."

At 7:45 PM, they moved.

Mara went west. Staying in shadows. The flare was in her hand. Ready. She reached the west side of the school. The cars were there. Circling. Patient. Waiting for someone to make a mistake.

She struck the flare.

It ignited with a hiss and a spray of sparks. Brilliant red light. Chemical smell. Heat against her face.

Every car turned toward her. Engines revving. A mechanical sound like anger.

Mara threw the flare as hard as she could. It landed in the middle of the parking lot. Still burning. Still bright. Still drawing every sensor and camera in the area.

The cars converged on it.

Mara ran north. Away from the light. Into the darkness. She could hear the cars behind her. Searching. Confused. The flare had worked. For now.

She circled around. Back toward the restaurant. Back toward—

A car blocked her path. Sedan. Headlights off. Engine idling. Waiting.

It had anticipated her route. Cut her off.

Mara dove right. Through a hedge. The branches tore at her face and arms. She came out the other side and kept running.

The sedan followed. Faster now. Not confused anymore. Locked on.

Mara's lungs burned. Her legs burned. The medical bag slammed against her hip. She couldn't keep this pace. Couldn't outrun a machine.

The Thai restaurant was ahead. The back door was open. She could see Marcus standing in the doorway. Waving her in.

"Come on!"

Twenty yards. Fifteen. Ten.

The sedan was right behind her. She could hear it. Feel it.

Five yards.

She dove through the door. Marcus slammed it shut. The sedan hit the door a second later. The whole building shook. Metal shrieked. But the door held.

Mara lay on the kitchen floor. Gasping. Shaking. Alive.

"That was insane," Marcus said.

"Did you get in? Did you reach the school?"

"No. We tried. But Janet—" He gestured to the dining room.

Mara pulled herself up. Followed him.

Janet was on the floor. Tyler beside her. The woman's eyes were closed. Her breathing shallow.

"She collapsed," Tyler said. "Right before we got to the parking lot. I couldn't leave her."

Mara knelt beside Janet. Checked her pulse. Checked her pupils. Both blown now. The head injury was worse. Much worse.

"We need to get her to a hospital," Tyler said.

Mara looked at him. At Marcus. At Janet lying on the floor of a ransacked restaurant while cars prowled outside and hospitals burned across the city.

"Yeah," Mara said. "We do."

But they all knew the truth. There were no hospitals. No ambulances. No help coming.

There was just this moment. This restaurant. These people. And a school four blocks away with their daughters inside and no way to reach them.

Not yet.

But Mara would find a way. She had to.

For Zoe. For Nina. For all the kids trapped in that building.

She just had to figure out how.
