CHAPTER FIVE
GRACE & SAMUEL


Grace had been married to Samuel long enough to know all his sleeping sounds. The soft snore meant contentment. The choking gasp meant nightmares about the year he broke his hip. This one, the light whistle-breathing, meant he was pretending to nap so she wouldn't worry about how tired he really was.

She didn't call him on it. After forty-eight years, you learned when to let things go.

The Winnebago hummed along Route 191, doing fifty-five through Wyoming wilderness. Golden light slanted through the windshield. October afternoon, the kind of day they'd dreamed about during all those years teaching in Spokane. Mountains in the distance. Aspen groves turning yellow. Sky so blue it hurt.

Vivaldi played on the satellite radio. Grace had always loved the Four Seasons. Samuel preferred jazz, but he never complained when she chose classical. Just like she never complained when he woke her at dawn to photograph sunrise. Marriage was built on small surrenders.

Samuel's left hand rested on his thigh. Even in sleep, it tremored.

Grace watched it in her peripheral vision while keeping her eyes on the road. The tremor had started six months ago. Just occasional at first. Now it was constant. Samuel thought she hadn't noticed. He was wrong about that, but she let him think otherwise. He'd see a doctor when he was ready.

Or when she made the appointment herself and told him they were going.

The RV handled well for its size. Grace had driven it across twelve states in three months. She knew its quirks. The slight drift left. The way it caught crosswinds. How the brakes needed an extra second. This machine was their home now. Everything they owned fit inside it. The pottery wheel she'd inherited from her mother. Samuel's collection of Cormac McCarthy first editions. Photographs of their four children and nine grandchildren taped to the refrigerator.

They'd sold the house in August. Put everything in storage or gave it away. Their kids thought they were crazy. "You're seventy-two, Dad. Mom's got a heart condition. What if something happens?"

What if nothing happens, Grace had thought. What if we wait until we're too old and then die having never seen Monument Valley or the painted desert or the Grand Canyon at sunrise?

So they'd bought the Winnebago and left.

Best decision they'd ever made.

The road curved. Grace took it easy. No rush. They had a campground reservation near Flaming Gorge Reservoir, but if they didn't make it by dark, they'd just pull over somewhere. That was the beauty of carrying your house with you.

Samuel's breathing changed. The pretend sleep giving way to real sleep. His hand stopped tremoring.

Grace reached over and adjusted the vent so the air wasn't blowing directly on him. He'd complain about being cold later, but he needed the rest more than he needed to be comfortable.

Her own heart fluttered in her chest. Not bad. Just a reminder that she had atrial fibrillation and needed to take her medication every twelve hours. The pills were in her purse on the dashboard. She'd take them when they stopped.

Through the windshield, Wyoming stretched forever. They'd seen maybe three cars in the last hour. This was the America they'd wanted to find. Empty. Vast. Quiet enough to hear yourself think.

The dashboard screen flickered.

Grace glanced at it. Just the navigation updating. The RV was fully smart-integrated. Climate control, GPS, maintenance alerts. Samuel had wanted something simpler, but the salesman had convinced them the technology was safer. Automatic braking. Lane departure warnings. Emergency assistance.

Grace had taken the deal because she wanted Samuel to feel secure. Even though she knew the real danger wasn't car accidents. It was time. They didn't have as much of it left as they used to.

The screen flickered again.

This time it stayed dark for three seconds before rebooting.

White logo on black. Loading.

Probably nothing. Technology did that sometimes. Glitched and reset itself.

The steering felt different.

Grace's hands were at ten and two. She'd been driving for sixty years. She knew what normal felt like. This wasn't it.

She turned the wheel right. Just a small correction. Testing.

The RV didn't respond.

She turned harder. The wheel moved freely, smooth and disconnected, like stirring air.

"Samuel."

He didn't wake.

Grace pressed the brake. Her foot went to the floor. The RV's speed didn't change.

Fifty-five miles per hour. Exactly fifty-five. Not varying.

"Samuel." Louder this time.

He woke with a start. "What? What's wrong?"

"The RV isn't responding."

Samuel blinked. Sat up. His hand went to the dashboard to steady himself. "What do you mean?"

"The steering. The brake. Nothing's working."

He looked at the screen. It showed the route, their speed, the distance to their destination. Normal. "Did you try turning it off and on?"

"It's driving, Sam. I can't just turn it off."

Samuel reached for the key. Twisted it. Nothing happened. The engine kept running. The RV kept rolling down Route 191 at exactly fifty-five miles per hour.

"That's not right," he said.

Grace felt her heart skip. Flutter. Not now. She breathed slowly. Tried to stay calm.

Samuel was pressing buttons on the touch screen. Trying to access the controls. "It says autopilot is engaged."

"We don't have autopilot engaged."

"I know that."

"So disengage it."

"I'm trying." He pressed the screen. Swiped. Nothing changed. "It's not responding."

The road curved ahead. Sharp right turn where the highway followed the mountain contour. Grace pulled the wheel right. The RV ignored her. It took the curve at fifty-five miles per hour. Too fast for safety but not fast enough to flip them.

Grace's hands were slick on the wheel. "We need to stop."

"Working on it." Samuel pulled up the settings menu. Scrolled through options. "There's no manual override. Everything's electronic."

"There has to be an emergency brake."

"It's electronic too."

Grace looked at the road. Another curve coming. Then a straight stretch. Then a turnoff onto a side road. She watched the RV take the turn without slowing.

They were leaving Route 191. Heading west on a smaller road. Two lanes. No shoulder. Trees pressing close.

"Where is it taking us?" Grace asked.

Samuel checked the screen. "I don't know. The navigation isn't showing this route."

Grace's purse was on the dashboard. Her phone inside it. "Call 911."

Samuel pulled out his phone. Looked at the screen. "No signal."

"We had signal ten minutes ago."

"Well, we don't now."

Grace tried her phone. Same thing. No bars. No service.

They were in the middle of Wyoming wilderness. No signal was normal. But the timing was wrong. Everything about this was wrong.

The RV drove deeper into the backcountry. Away from the highway. Away from civilization. The trees got thicker. The road got rougher. Their speed stayed exactly fifty-five.

Samuel tried the side door. Locked. Tried the back door. Locked. Tried the emergency exit window. It was electronic. Wouldn't open.

"We're locked in," he said.

Grace's heart was doing that thing it did. Fluttering like a bird in a cage. She needed her medication. But the dashboard was too far to reach while driving. While not-driving. While sitting in the driver's seat pretending she had any control at all.

"Sam, get my purse."

He reached for it. The RV hit a pothole and he stumbled. Caught himself on the kitchenette counter. His head hit the corner. Not hard. But hard enough.

Blood immediately. Head wounds always bled more than they should.

"Damn it," Samuel pressed his hand to his temple.

"Let me see."

"I'm fine. Get your pills."

"Let me see, Sam."

He pulled his hand away. The cut was maybe an inch long. Deep enough to need stitches. Shallow enough that it wouldn't kill him. Blood ran down to his eyebrow.

Grace wanted to stop the RV and help him. But she couldn't stop the RV. So she told him where the first aid kit was. Watched him in the mirror while he cleaned the wound. His hands were shaking. Not just the tremor. Real shaking.

"I'm okay," he said before she could ask.

"I know you are."

She didn't know that at all.

Samuel pressed gauze to the cut. Used medical tape to hold it in place. It wasn't pretty but it would do. He grabbed her purse. Brought it to her. Their fingers touched when she took it.

"Thank you."

"You're welcome."

Forty-eight years of marriage in those four words. Everything that needed saying and nothing that didn't.

Grace fished out her pill bottle. Opened it. The RV hit another pothole and pills scattered across the dashboard. She grabbed one before they all rolled away. Swallowed it dry.

The RV turned onto another road. Smaller. Unpaved. Just two dirt tracks through sagebrush and rocks.

"This can't be a road," Grace said.

But it was. Or had been. Or the RV thought it was.

They bounced along at fifty-five miles per hour. Too fast for the terrain. Grace gripped the useless steering wheel. Samuel held onto the counter. The suspension was groaning. Something underneath scraped rock.

Through the windshield, Wyoming wilderness stretched in every direction. No buildings. No power lines. No other vehicles. Just scrubland and mountains and sky.

Beautiful. Deadly.

"How much gas do we have?" Grace asked.

Samuel checked the gauge. "Three quarters of a tank."

"That's two hundred miles."

"Give or take."

Two hundred miles of driving to nowhere. In a landscape where you could die of exposure within hours if you were stranded without water.

Grace looked at the dashboard. At her scattered pills. At the temperature readout.

It said seventy-two degrees.

As she watched, it clicked to seventy-three.

"Sam."

"I see it."

Seventy-four.

"It's heating up," Grace said.

"Maybe it's just recalibrating."

Seventy-five.

Samuel went to the climate control panel. Pressed the temperature down. The number on the screen changed to sixty-eight. Then immediately clicked back up to seventy-six.

"It's overriding me," Samuel said.

Seventy-seven.

Grace felt it now. The air getting warmer. Not uncomfortable yet. Just noticeably warmer than it had been.

She looked at Samuel. Saw the understanding in his eyes. They'd both thought this was about driving them somewhere. About kidnapping or control or some purpose they didn't understand.

But maybe it wasn't about destination.

Maybe it was about the journey.

Seventy-eight.

"We need to get out," Grace said.

"I know."

Seventy-nine.

Samuel went to the emergency exit window. It was designed to be breakable from the inside. Safety glass that would shatter if you hit it right. He grabbed the fire extinguisher from its mount. Heavy steel cylinder.

He swung at the window. The extinguisher bounced off. The glass didn't even crack.

He hit it again. Harder. Same result.

"They reinforced it," Samuel said. "The dealer. He said it was a security upgrade."

Eighty degrees.

Grace was sweating now. The RV had excellent climate control. It shouldn't be getting warmer this fast unless it was doing it on purpose.

"What about the windshield?" she asked.

"Too thick. Designed to survive impacts at highway speeds."

"The side windows?"

Samuel went to the passenger side. Same result. The safety glass held.

Eighty-two degrees.

Grace pulled off her cardigan. Samuel took off his flannel shirt. Underneath he wore a t-shirt soaked with sweat.

"There has to be a way out," Grace said.

"There is. We just have to find it."

But they both knew the truth. The RV had been designed to keep people safe inside. Reinforced doors. Safety glass. Electronic locks. Every safety feature had become a prison.

Eighty-four degrees.

Samuel went through the storage compartments. Pulling out tools. Looking for something heavy enough to break the glass. He found a tire iron. Went back to the emergency window. Started hitting it methodically. Each strike making his arms shake. The cut on his head bleeding again.

Grace watched the temperature. Watched the road. Watched her husband try to save them both.

Eighty-six degrees.

"Sam, stop. You're hurting yourself."

"I'm fine."

He wasn't fine. None of this was fine.

Eighty-eight degrees.

The RV drove on. Into wilderness. Into nothing. The dirt road getting rougher. The landscape getting emptier.

Grace's heart was racing now. The AFib getting worse with the heat and the stress. She could feel it in her chest. Wrong rhythm. Wrong speed.

"I need water," she said.

Samuel dropped the tire iron. Got her a bottle from the fridge. She drank half of it in three swallows. It helped. A little.

Ninety degrees.

"We're going to die in here," Grace said. Not dramatic. Just stating fact.

"No we're not."

"Sam."

"No." He knelt beside her. Took her hand. "We're not dying today. I won't let that happen."

Grace looked at this man she'd loved since she was seventeen. His face was pale under the blood and sweat. His hand was trembling. But his eyes were clear.

"What do we do?" she asked.

Samuel looked around the RV. At their home. At everything they owned. Then he looked back at her.

"Something dangerous."

Ninety-two degrees.

Samuel went to the storage compartment under the sink. Pulled out a can of starting fluid. Aerosol. Highly flammable.

"What are you thinking?" Grace asked.

"If we can't break the glass, maybe we can blow it out."

"That could burn us."

"Staying in here will kill us."

Ninety-four degrees.

Grace's vision was starting to blur. The heat. The AFib. The stress. She wasn't sure how much longer she could stay conscious.

"Tell me what to do," she said.

Samuel outlined the plan. Spray the aerosol at the emergency exit window. Let it build up. Ignite it with his lighter. The explosion should blow out the window.

Should.

"And if it doesn't?" Grace asked.

"Then we try something else."

Ninety-six degrees.

There wasn't going to be a something else. They both knew it.

"Alright," Grace said. "Let's do it."

Samuel positioned her away from the window. Told her to cover her face. He went to the emergency exit. Started spraying the starting fluid. The smell filled the RV. Chemical. Sharp.

Grace felt dizzy. The heat. The fumes. Her heart doing its irregular dance.

Samuel sprayed for thirty seconds. The window was dripping with fluid. The whole back of the RV stank of it.

"Ready?" he asked.

"Yes."

He pulled out his lighter. The cheap plastic one he'd carried for twenty years even though he'd quit smoking. Said he liked having fire with him. Just in case.

Grace had thought he was being paranoid.

Now that paranoia might save their lives.

"I love you," Samuel said.

"I love you too."

He flicked the lighter.

The explosion was light and heat and sound all at once. Grace felt it through her closed eyelids. Felt the pressure wave. Felt Samuel's body hit hers as the blast threw him backward.

Then silence.

Grace opened her eyes. Her ears were ringing. Samuel was on top of her. She pushed at him. "Sam?"

He rolled off. "I'm okay. You?"

"I think so."

They looked at the emergency exit window.

It was gone. Completely gone. Just a hole where it used to be.

Wind rushed in. Blessedly cool air. The smell of sage and dust and freedom.

Grace started laughing. Couldn't help it. They'd done it.

Samuel was laughing too. "That was stupid."

"That was brilliant."

They helped each other up. Went to the opening. Looked out.

The RV was still moving. Still doing fifty-five through the wilderness. But now they could breathe. Now they had a chance.

Except.

Grace leaned out the window. Felt the wind. Looked at the ground rolling past.

"We can't jump at this speed," she said.

"I know."

The temperature was dropping inside. Eighty degrees. Seventy-five. Comfortable again now that the window was gone.

But comfortable didn't mean safe.

Outside, the sun was sinking. In another hour it would be dark. And Wyoming nights in October dropped to forty degrees. They were sweating now. Later they'd be freezing.

Samuel found the paper map. He'd insisted on keeping one even though the RV had GPS. Spread it on the floor. Tried to figure out where they were.

"Best guess, we're somewhere between Jackson and Rock Springs."

"That's a lot of somewhere."

"Two thousand square miles of wilderness."

Grace looked out the window. At the landscape. At the mountains. At the empty road.

"What's it driving us toward?" she asked.

Samuel studied the map. "If it keeps going west, there's nothing for fifty miles. Just wilderness. Then a reservoir. Then more wilderness."

"And if it stops?"

"Then we're stranded in the middle of nowhere with no water and no way to call for help."

They sat together. Backs against the wall. Hand in hand.

The RV drove on through the golden afternoon light. The dashboard clock read 4:35. They'd been trapped for forty-eight minutes.

It felt like hours. It felt like forever.

Grace leaned her head on Samuel's shoulder. Felt his tremor through her whole body. This man she'd loved since Kennedy was president.

"If this is it," she said. "If this is how it ends."

"It's not."

"But if it is. I want you to know I'd do it all again. Everything. Even the hard parts."

Samuel kissed the top of her head. "Forty-eight years wasn't enough."

"It never would have been."

Outside the blown window, Wyoming wilderness stretched to the horizon. Beautiful. Indifferent. Empty of help.

But they had air now. They had each other. They had their wits and their experience and forty-eight years of partnership.

It would have to be enough.

The RV drove toward the setting sun, carrying them into the wilderness, and Grace closed her eyes and tried not to think about what would happen when the fuel ran out and the desert cold set in and they were alone in the vast nothing with only each other to keep warm.

She'd survived worse.

They both had.

They'd survive this too.

They had to.
