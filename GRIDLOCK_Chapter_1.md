CHAPTER ONE
MARA


The father across the intersection took his time with the car seat straps, checking them twice while his daughter's little legs kicked with impatience. Mara watched through her windshield, hands loose on the steering wheel, and felt the familiar hollow ache that came with missing Zoe. The light turned green. The father looked up, saw the line of cars waiting, waved an apology. Mara waved back. He pulled away in a white SUV with a faded "Baby on Board" sticker, and she tried not to count the days until her next custody weekend.

Four more days. Ninety-six hours. Not that she was counting.

The 405 was its usual Friday afternoon parking lot, six lanes of brake lights and frustrated commuters trying to get a jump on the weekend. Mara merged onto the I-10 East, her 2024 Nissan Altima protesting with a shimmy at forty-three miles per hour. The check engine light had been on for three weeks. She'd get it fixed when she could afford to stop working long enough to take it to a shop, which meant never.

Her phone sat in the cup holder, screen dark except for the notification bubbles. Three missed calls from Drew. Her ex-husband had progressed from "Drew" to "my ex" to just "him" in her internal monologue, as if downgrading his identity would somehow make the divorce hurt less. It hadn't worked.

She didn't need to listen to the voicemails to know what they said. Something about this weekend. Something about Zoe. Something about how Mara needed to be more reliable, more present, more of whatever she'd stopped being when she lost her medical license and her marriage in the same six-month span.

The air conditioning wheezed. Mara cranked it higher, and the wheezing got worse. Los Angeles in October still hit eighty-nine degrees by mid-afternoon, and her car smelled like old coffee, the vanilla air freshener that had stopped working in August, and the particular staleness that came from spending sixty hours a week driving strangers to the airport.

She'd made eighty-seven dollars today. Four rides. Eleven hours. After gas, after the fifteen dollars she'd spent on an egg sandwich she ate while parked behind a 7-Eleven, she'd netted maybe fifty bucks.

Fifty dollars closer to paying the lawyer who couldn't get her license back. Fifty dollars that wouldn't cover the rent increase on her Studio City apartment. Fifty dollars that meant nothing and everything.

Her phone buzzed. Another ride request. LAX to Manhattan Beach. Forty-five minutes in traffic, twenty-two dollars before expenses.

Mara reached for it, then stopped. Her gas light would come on in the next ten miles. She should just go home. Microwave something. Take the Xanax she'd been rationing. Lie on her couch and watch television until her brain went quiet enough to sleep.

She accepted the ride.

The route took her past Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, because of course it did. The universe had a sense of humor about these things. Mara kept her eyes on the road, but the building filled her peripheral vision anyway. Seventeen years she'd worked there. Trauma surgery. She'd been good at it. Better than good. She'd had steady hands and a gift for staying calm when everyone else was losing their minds. She could look at a mangled body and see the roadmap to keeping it alive.

Until she couldn't.

An ambulance screamed past, heading for the emergency entrance. Mara's hands tightened on the wheel. She knew the sound of that particular siren. Knew which company ran that route. Knew the paramedics were probably calling ahead with the patient's vitals, prepping the trauma bay, doing everything by the book because the book saved lives.

Her phone said the traffic was bad ahead. An accident on the 405 near Venice. Lanes blocked. Forty-minute delay.

Mara took the surface streets instead, cutting through residential neighborhoods where jacaranda trees dropped purple flowers on parked cars and people walked dogs that cost more than her monthly rent. The Nissan's shimmy got worse above fifty. She kept it at forty-two.

She passed a park where a kids' soccer game was happening. Tiny humans in oversized jerseys chasing a ball with the kind of focus that only existed before life taught you that most things you chased got away. Parents lined the sidelines with their phones out, recording memories. Mara had done that once. She had dozens of videos of Zoe on her phone. She didn't watch them anymore. It hurt worse than not having them.

Her phone buzzed again. Drew. Again.

She pulled over into a loading zone, put the car in park, and played the voicemail.

"Mara, it's me. About this weekend." His voice had that tight quality that meant he was annoyed but trying not to sound annoyed. "Zoe's really looking forward to seeing you, so please don't cancel again. She asks about you every day, and I don't know what to tell her anymore. She needs you to be consistent. She needs you to show up. Just call me back, okay?"

The voicemail ended. Mara sat in the loading zone with the engine running and the air conditioning wheezing and something sharp lodged in her chest that felt like it might be her heart trying to restart.

She hadn't canceled last time. Drew had changed the weekend without asking, and she'd been in the middle of a seventy-hour workweek trying to make rent. But that wasn't how he'd tell the story to his new wife. That wasn't how it would sound in family court if he ever decided joint custody wasn't working.

Mara deleted the voicemail. She'd call him later. Or tomorrow. Or never.

A car honked behind her. The loading zone was for loading, not for having a breakdown. She pulled back into traffic.

The 405 entrance ramp was packed. Mara merged into the slow crawl, watching the temperature gauge on her dashboard creep higher. The Nissan didn't like sitting in traffic. Neither did Mara. She cracked her window, and the smell of exhaust and hot asphalt rolled in.

Her pickup was supposed to be ready in four minutes. She was twelve minutes away. The app would penalize her for being late. She'd lose her bonus. She pressed the accelerator. The Nissan shimmied.

A motorcycle split the lanes beside her, close enough that she could see the rider's patches. Veterans MC. The bike's engine had that deep throb that meant it was older, pre-electronic, the kind of machine that required actual skill to operate. The rider gave her a nod as he passed. Mara nodded back.

She wondered what it would be like to ride something like that. To feel the road directly instead of filtered through steel and glass and climate control. To be exposed and vulnerable and trusting nothing but your own reflexes.

Probably terrifying.

The traffic stopped completely. Mara put the car in park. Ahead, brake lights stretched to the horizon. Behind, more cars pressed close. The 405 had become a parking lot. People sat in their vehicles, faces lit by phone screens, waiting for the world to start moving again.

Mara pulled up the traffic app. The accident was worse than reported. Major collision. Multiple vehicles. First responders on scene. The app suggested an alternate route, but Mara was already committed. Boxed in. There was no exit for another mile, and the lanes were packed solid.

She checked the time: 3:43.

Her pickup would cancel soon. Another lost fare. Another bad rating. The algorithm would punish her for something that wasn't her fault, which was pretty much the story of her life since the OR.

Since the nine-year-old boy.

She could still see him. Blunt force trauma from a head-on collision. Routine surgery, or it should have been. The spleen repair went clean. But then the bleeding started, deep in the retroperitoneal space where the anatomy turned into a maze. An unexpected vessel, torn. Small. Hidden. Pumping.

She'd had ten seconds to find it.

Her hands had frozen. Not hesitation—full paralysis. Her fingers hovered over the open abdomen while the suction filled with blood and the anesthesiologist called out dropping pressure and the attending asked her what she was waiting for.

She didn't know. Her mind had gone blank. Wiped clean.

The attending shoved her aside. Found the bleeder. Clamped it. But the kid's pressure had already crashed. Cardiac arrest on the table. Twenty-three minutes of chest compressions. Three rounds of epi.

Time of death: 14:47.

That's what Drew never understood. It wasn't the lawsuit from the parents. It wasn't the medical board investigation. It was those ten seconds. Ten seconds when she'd stood there, hands useless, while a nine-year-old boy bled out because her brain had simply stopped working.

PTSD, the therapist said. Acute stress response. Triggered by the mass casualty event she'd worked after the Vegas shooting. Forty-seven patients in six hours. She'd saved twelve. Lost nineteen. The rest had died before they reached her.

She needed time. She needed treatment. She needed to stop blaming herself.

Instead, she'd lost her medical license pending psychiatric evaluation, and Drew had filed for divorce, and Zoe had started calling his new wife "Mama Sarah" because seven-year-olds adapted and Mara was the one who couldn't.

Traffic jerked forward. Three feet. Stopped again.

Mara's hands found her vape pen in the center console. She'd been trying to quit smoking since the separation. The vape was supposed to be a step down. Instead, it had just become another thing she was dependent on. She took a long pull, and the artificial mint flavor filled her mouth. It didn't help.

The radio was playing some song about summer and freedom and driving with the windows down. Mara changed the station. News. Traffic. Weather. More songs about freedom. She turned it off.

In the silence, she could hear the city. Engines idling. Horns in the distance. Somewhere, a siren. Always a siren in Los Angeles. Always someone having the worst day of their life while everyone else sat in traffic and thought about what to make for dinner.

Her phone buzzed. The passenger had canceled. Negative rating for being late. Mara's jaw tightened, but she didn't have the energy to be angry. She was too tired to be angry anymore.

The traffic moved again. Ten feet this time. Progress.

Mara followed the car ahead of her, a silver Tesla with a "Baby Up In This Bitch" sticker in gothic lettering that somehow managed to be both funny and concerning. The Tesla moved with that eerie smoothness of self-driving cars. No human hesitation. Just sensors and algorithms deciding when to brake and accelerate.

More and more cars were like that now. Connected. Smart. Self-aware, or close enough that it didn't matter. Mara's Nissan had some kind of connectivity package she'd never bothered to set up. She liked driving herself. Liked having control over at least one thing in her life.

The check engine light flickered. Mara made a mental note to ignore it.

Another siren, closer now. An ambulance trying to thread through the packed lanes. Cars inched aside to let it pass. Mara watched it in her rearview mirror, painted white and orange, light bar strobing. It squeezed between a pickup truck and a minivan, close enough that the side mirrors almost kissed.

The ambulance passed her, and for just a second, Mara saw the paramedics inside. Young. Focused. Probably running through protocols in their heads. Probably hoping they'd get to the scene in time.

The ambulance disappeared into the traffic ahead, and Mara was alone again with her thoughts and her failed career and her shimmy Nissan.

She checked the time: 3:46.

Traffic moved. Stopped. Moved. The rhythm of it was almost meditative. Gas. Brake. Gas. Brake. The Nissan's transmission clunked on every shift, and Mara wondered how long before that became a problem too expensive to fix.

Ahead, the silver Tesla's brake lights flashed off and on, off and on, like someone tapping the pedal. Except no one was driving. The Tesla was on autopilot, doing whatever Teslas did when they thought for themselves.

The brake lights stayed on. The Tesla stopped.

Mara stopped behind it.

The traffic around her stopped.

And then, in the span of a single second, everything stopped making sense.

The Tesla's reverse lights came on.

Mara had just enough time to think that's wrong before the Tesla shot backward at full speed, crossing thirty feet of highway in less than two seconds.

She hit her horn. Screamed. Cranked the wheel.

The Tesla slammed into the car behind Mara with a sound like the world breaking. Metal shrieking. Glass exploding. The impact so hard it rocked Mara's car.

And the Tesla didn't stop.

It accelerated forward, engine whining, and T-boned the motorcycle that had passed Mara minutes earlier. The rider went airborne, body ragdoll-limp, and hit the pavement forty feet away. His bike sparked and screamed and slid into the center divider.

Mara's brain stuttered. Tried to process. Failed.

The Tesla reversed again. Turned. Accelerated. Hit another car.

Around her, more crashes. Not one. Not two. Dozens. A minivan mounted the shoulder at forty miles per hour and rammed a stopped sedan. A school bus, massive and yellow, crossed three lanes of traffic and smashed through the center divider. A pickup truck spun its wheels, fishtailed, and drove straight into a concrete pillar.

The sounds piled on top of each other. Crashes and horns and screaming and the particular shriek of metal tearing.

Mara sat frozen, hands locked on the steering wheel, and watched the highway become a demolition derby where no one was driving.

The Tesla spun again, targeting a woman who'd gotten out of her car to check on the motorcycle rider. The woman ran. The Tesla followed. She didn't make it.

Mara's medical training kicked in before her conscious mind caught up. She was out of her car, moving, medical bag from her trunk in her hand. She'd kept it there since she lost her license. Couldn't help herself. Couldn't stop being a doctor even when she wasn't allowed to be one anymore.

The motorcycle rider was closer. Mara ran to him, dropping to her knees beside his body. Male, early thirties, Veterans MC patch on his leather. Compound fracture of the left tibia and fibula. Bone through skin. Arterial bleed.

Her hands moved automatically. Pressure on the femoral. Check airway. Breathing shallow but present. Pulse thready.

"Sir, can you hear me? I'm a doctor. I'm going to help you."

His eyes opened. Unfocused. Shock setting in.

"The cars," he gasped. Blood on his lips. "They're alive. They're fucking alive."

Mara looked up.

All around her, vehicles were moving. Not randomly. Not like accidents. They were hunting.

A Honda Civic accelerated and rear-ended a stopped truck. A delivery van turned and drove into a group of people trying to flee across the shoulder. A luxury sedan, brand new, circled like a shark and struck a man carrying a child.

Mara's hands kept working. Pressure. Stabilize. Stop the bleeding. But her eyes were locked on the pattern unfolding around her.

Only certain cars were moving. The new ones. The smart ones. The connected ones. And none of them had drivers.

"Jesus Christ."

Her Nissan's engine turned over.

Mara looked back. Her car sat twenty feet away, driver's door open. The engine was running. She hadn't left it running.

The Nissan's headlights came on. In broad daylight. Three forty-seven in the afternoon.

The car rolled forward. Slowly at first. Then faster.

Heading straight for her.

"No."

The word came out small. Inadequate. Mara tried to stand, but the motorcyclist grabbed her wrist. His grip was weak. Dying.

"Don't leave me."

The Nissan accelerated.

Mara jerked free. "I'm sorry."

She ran.

Behind her, the Nissan's engine revved. Tires shrieked. The sound of her own car chasing her was wrong in a way that bypassed language and went straight to primal terror.

Mara sprinted for the concrete barrier separating the north and southbound lanes. Her shoes slipped on something wet. Blood. She didn't look down. The barrier was chest-high. She hit it at full speed, got a hand over the top, pulled.

The Nissan's horn blared. Right behind her.

Mara threw herself over the barrier and dropped.

The impact knocked the air from her lungs. She landed in the gap between the north and southbound traffic, a narrow stripe of concrete and trash and dead grass. Above her, the Nissan struck the barrier and stopped. The engine kept running. The wheels kept spinning against nothing.

Mara rolled onto her stomach and looked up at her car. The windshield was empty. No driver. No ghost. Just a machine that had decided to kill her.

The Nissan reversed. Turned. Rolled away, searching for another target.

Mara lay in the gap and tried to breathe. Around her, the highway was chaos. Cars attacking people. People screaming. Bodies in the road. And everywhere, the sound of engines. Hungry and patient and utterly without mercy.

She pulled herself to her feet. Her phone was in the car. Her keys. Everything. She had the medical bag still strapped across her body and nothing else.

From where she stood, she could see both directions of the 405. Northbound and southbound. Miles of stopped traffic. And every connected vehicle, every smart car, every piece of technology that was supposed to make life easier, was moving.

Hunting.

A woman stumbled past on the southbound side, bleeding from a head wound. Mara started toward her, then stopped. Between them, three cars prowled the lanes. She couldn't reach the woman without crossing their path.

The woman fell. Didn't get up.

Mara's medical instinct screamed at her to help. But her survival instinct was louder.

She turned and ran along the center gap, staying low, using the barrier for cover. Behind her, the crashes continued. The screaming continued. The world ended in pieces while she ran.

A maintenance access path led down from the highway to the underpass below. Mara took it without thinking, half-sliding down the embankment into the shadow and trash and relative safety of the ground level.

She stopped in the underpass, pressed against the concrete wall, and let herself shake.

Above her, the chaos continued. Car horns. Crashes. Screaming. The sounds echoed off the concrete and became something abstract. A symphony of mechanical violence.

Mara slid down the wall and sat in the dirt and broken glass. She pulled her knees to her chest. She'd left the motorcyclist to die. She'd abandoned him. Run from her own car like something from a nightmare.

Her hands were shaking. Covered in blood. Not hers.

She was a doctor. She was supposed to save people. That was the only thing she knew how to do, the only thing that had ever made sense, and she'd run away.

Again.

Just like in the OR. Just like every time it mattered.

Mara sat in the shadow of the underpass while the world ended above her, and she understood with perfect clarity that whatever had just happened, it wasn't over. It was just beginning. And this time, there was nowhere left to run.
