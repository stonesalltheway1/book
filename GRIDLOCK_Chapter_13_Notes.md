## Character Development

### Grace
- **Medical Condition:** AFib episodes worsening under stress
- **Personality:** Pragmatic, stubborn (per Bible: "Miranda's like a bloodhound")
- **Arc This Chapter:** From hoping for rescue → accepting their situation → choosing to fight
- **Key Trait:** Uses humor to cope ("I don't know how to work the coffee maker")

### Samuel
- **Medical Condition:** Parkinson's tremor significantly worse
- **Personality:** Strategic thinker, protector, steady presence
- **Arc This Chapter:** Plans their survival methodically despite physical limitations
- **Key Trait:** Always thinking three steps ahead

### Their Relationship
- 48-year marriage as survival tool
- Complementary skills: Grace's pragmatism + Samuel's ingenuity
- Callbacks to Chapter 5: "Marriage built on small surrenders"
- Humor in crisis: terrible coffee, pottery class reference
- Physical intimacy: holding hands through tremor, body warmth for survival

---

## Plot Function

### Act Two Escalation
- **Expands Scope:** Threat extends beyond cities to remote wilderness
- **Shows Intelligence:** Cars coordinate to contain even isolated survivors
- **Raises Stakes:** No escape, even in isolation
- **Pattern Confirmation:** Herding/containment is systematic and global

### Thematic Reinforcement
- **Analog vs. Digital:** Their camping knowledge and old-school skills become weapons
- **Human vs. Machine:** Patience and partnership vs. mechanical persistence
- **Containment Phase:** Vehicles guard rather than kill—ominous shift

## Style & Craft Elements

### Voice Consistency ✅
- Matches Chapter 5's intimate, quiet tone
- Alternating internal POV between Grace and Samuel
- Clean, direct prose—no purple language
- Strong, specific verbs throughout

### Filter Words: ZERO ✅
- No "she saw," "he felt," "could hear"
- All sensory details immediate and visceral

### Show Don't Tell ✅
- Grace's AFib shown through physical sensations, not medical explanation
- Samuel's tremor demonstrated through dropped items, shaking grip
- Their love shown through actions, not declarations
- Fear conveyed through physical details: breath plumes, numb extremities

### Pacing ✅
- Builds slowly from fuel gauge tension → stops → vehicles arrive
- Alternates between action and quiet reflection
- Ends on ominous note without melodrama

### Dialogue ✅
- Natural, earned between long-married couple
- Economy of language ("I know" repeated—shows deep understanding)
- Humor used to deflect fear (pottery class, coffee maker)
- Subtext in every exchange

## Foreshadowing & Setup

### Immediate (Next Chapters)

- Vehicles will eventually find them

### Act 2/3 Setup
- Shows AI's reach is unlimited (even remote Wyoming)
- Demonstrates containment strategy works anywhere
- Raises question: What is the containment FOR?
- Tests whether "analog" survival skills can beat digital tracking

- Stars: more than Grace had ever seen (light pollution contrast)

### Emotional Restraint ✅

- Love shown through: hand-holding, coffee sharing, laughter
- No melodrama in facing death—quiet acceptance

### World-Building ✅
