# GRIDLOCK: Continuity Bible Update
## Additional Character Details (2025-11-06)

### GRACE & SAMUEL - Family Details

**Addition to Character Dossier:**

**Grace & Samuel's Children:**
- Four adult children (names not specified in current draft)
- Nine grandchildren (names/ages not specified in current draft)
- Photographs taped to RV refrigerator
- Children thought the retirement trip was "crazy" given Grace and Samuel's ages/health
- This detail appears in Chapter 5, line 19-20

**Canonical Reference:** GRIDLOCK_Chapter_5.txt, lines 19-21:
> "The pottery wheel she'd inherited from her mother. Samuel's collection of Cormac McCarthy first editions. Photographs of their four children and nine grandchildren taped to the refrigerator."

**Narrative Function:**
- Reinforces what they're risking/leaving behind
- Makes their "no regrets" retirement trip more poignant
- Creates stakes for their survival beyond just themselves

**Notes for Future Chapters:**
- If Grace or Samuel die, this creates additional tragedy (grandchildren losing grandparents)
- Could be used for emotional beats in epilogue if they survive
- Children could be trying to reach them, adding parallel rescue attempts
