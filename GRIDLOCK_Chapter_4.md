CHAPTER FOUR
VINCENT


Monitor 7 showed a teenage girl slipping a lipstick into her pocket at Sephora, and Vincent knew he should call it in, but she looked like Gabi. Same dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, same way of glancing around like the world was watching, same age where you thought you were invisible and invincible at the same time.

He took another bite of his sandwich and let her walk.

The security office at Desert Sky Mall was fifteen feet by twelve feet of fluorescent lights and humming monitors. Twenty-four screens showing every corner of the property. Vincent had worked here for three years, watching people shop and steal and live their lives, and he knew every camera angle like he knew the scars on his hands.

His phone sat next to the half-eaten turkey sandwich Elena had made him this morning. Back when they were still sleeping in different rooms but trying to pretend they weren't giving up. The sandwich was dry. She'd forgotten the mayo. Or maybe she hadn't forgotten. Maybe that was the point.

The phone screen lit up. Text from Gabi: *Jake's picking me up after school. Going to his place to study.*

Vincent's jaw tightened. Jake was seventeen with a brand new Chevy Bolt his parents had bought him. Self-driving. Voice-activated. More computer than car. And Jake was an idiot who thought owning expensive things made him mature.

He typed: *What are you studying?*

Three dots appeared. Disappeared. Appeared again.

*Calculus.*

Right. Calculus. Vincent had been seventeen once. He knew what studying meant at Jake's house with no parents home.

He typed: *Be home by 6.*

*Dad, I'm almost 18.*

*Be home by 6.*

The dots disappeared. No response. Which meant she was annoyed but would probably listen. Probably.

Vincent set the phone down and cycled through the monitors. Parking lot A: normal. Food court: normal. Main entrance: a family with a stroller. Parking lot B: some asshole taking up two spaces with his BMW.

This was his life now. Watching other people's problems while his own family fell apart in slow motion.

Four months ago, Elena had asked him to sleep in the guest room. Just for a while. Just until they figured things out. Gabi was pulling away. Coming home later. Spending more time with Jake. Dodging his questions. And Vincent kept showing up to this job and watching monitors because it was easier than going home and facing what he'd broken.

His phone buzzed. Elena: *Can you pick up milk on your way home?*

Like they were roommates. Like nineteen years of marriage had come down to grocery lists and separate bedrooms.

He didn't respond.

Monitor 14 caught his attention. Parking lot D, west side. Something off about the movement. Cars shifting positions. Not pulling in or pulling out. Just repositioning.

Vincent leaned forward.

Five cars, all moving at once. Like they were coordinating. Which didn't make sense unless there was some kind of event happening that he hadn't been told about.

He pulled up the events calendar on his computer. Nothing scheduled.

On the monitor, the cars continued their strange dance. Circling. Herding.

A woman walked across the lot toward her minivan. One of the circling cars accelerated. Straight at her.

"What the hell?"

Vincent was on his feet before he consciously decided to move. Years of military training. Threat assessment. Response.

The car hit the woman. Not a bump. Not an accident. A deliberate strike. She went down hard.

Vincent grabbed his radio. "This is Reyes, I need units to lot D, pedestrian down, possible vehicular assault."

Kendra's voice crackled back. "Copy, sending security team."

Vincent was already moving. Out of the office, down the corridor toward the west exit. His hand went to his belt. Radio. Flashlight. Baton. No firearm. Mall policy. In four years of Army service, he'd carried an M4. Now he had a stick.

"Reyes." Kendra again, voice tight. "We're getting multiple reports. Lots A through F. Vehicles acting erratically."

Vincent stopped. "Multiple? How many?"

"All of them. Every lot. Cars are moving and they're—Vincent, they're hitting people."

He started running.

The corridor opened into lot D. Desert Sky Mall was outdoor lots, exposed positions, nowhere to hide. Phoenix sun blazing at ninety-four degrees, heat radiating off asphalt and windshields.

The woman was on the ground between two cars. Not moving. A Honda Civic rolled toward her. Slowly. Like it was lining up another pass.

Vincent pulled his baton. Useless against a car. But it was what he had.

"HEY!" He ran toward the woman, waving his arms. "STOP!"

The Civic's headlights flashed. It accelerated.

Not at the woman.

At Vincent.

He dove behind a concrete planter at the last second. The Civic hit the planter doing forty. The sound was massive. Metal crumpling. Airbags deploying. The whole car shuddering with impact.

Vincent lay on his back, ears ringing, staring up at the empty driver's seat through the cracked windshield.

Empty.

No one was driving.

Around him, the chaos was spreading. More cars moving. People screaming. Running. The security team hadn't arrived yet. Maybe they weren't coming. Maybe they were smart enough to stay inside.

Vincent's phone rang.

He pulled it out. Gabi.

"Baby, where are you?"

"Dad." Her voice high and scared. Background noise. Someone yelling. An engine revving. "Dad, something's wrong. Jake's car won't stop."

Vincent pushed himself up. "What do you mean it won't stop?"

"We're on the 101 and it's going really fast and Jake's trying to brake but nothing's working and—"

"Gabi, listen to me. You need to get out of the car."

"We're going too fast!"

In the background, Jake's voice: "It's heading for the barrier! I can't control it!"

Vincent started running. Back toward the building. Toward his truck. Toward anything that could get him to his daughter.

"Dad, I'm scared."

"I know, baby. I know. But you need to jump out. Both of you. Right now."

"We're going so fast—"

"JUMP OUT OF THE CAR, GABI. NOW!"

The sound came through the phone. Impact. Metal tearing. Glass breaking. The particular shriek of a car being destroyed.

Then nothing.

"Gabi?"

Silence.

"GABI!"

The line was dead.

Vincent stopped in the middle of the parking lot. Tried to call back. The call wouldn't connect. Tried again. Same thing.

Around him, cars continued their hunt. A pickup truck mounted a curb and hit a light post. A sedan chased a man between parked cars. A minivan drove through the entrance of Macy's, glass exploding.

Vincent stood there with his dead phone and his useless baton, and something inside him went very quiet and very cold.

Gabi was on the 101. Northbound, probably. She'd been coming from school. Westview High, near Glendale. The 101 at this time of day, she'd be between the 51 and the I-17 interchange.

Ten miles away.

Vincent started moving.

His truck was in the employee lot on the east side. Quarter mile from where he stood. He ran.

A car pulled out in front of him. He vaulted over the hood. Kept running. His radio was squawking. Kendra's voice. Other security guards. Everyone panicking. He ignored it.

The employee lot was chaos. Security guards running. Customers fleeing. Cars circling like sharks.

Vincent's truck was a 2019 Ford F-150. Old enough that it didn't have the connectivity package. Manual controls. He'd bought it used specifically because he didn't trust computers.

He reached it. Keys out. Door open. Inside.

The engine turned over. Normal. The truck was fine.

He put it in gear and drove.

The exit was blocked. Three cars had created a barrier. Vincent didn't slow down. He aimed for the gap between a sedan and a concrete pillar. Eighteen inches of clearance. The truck's mirrors scraped both sides. Then he was through.

Out onto Euclid Avenue. Traffic was stopped. Crashed. Burning. Vincent drove on the shoulder. On the sidewalk when he had to. The F-150's suspension bounced over curbs and bodies and debris.

His phone was mounted on the dashboard. He tried calling Gabi again. Still wouldn't connect. Tried Elena. Same thing.

The radio worked. He found the emergency channel. Every unit in the city was screaming for help. Mass casualties everywhere. No pattern. No explanation.

"All vehicles have gone rogue," someone was saying. "I repeat, all connected vehicles are attacking civilians. Do not approach. Do not attempt to enter any smart vehicle."

Vincent turned it off. He didn't need commentary. He needed to get to his daughter.

The entrance to the 101 was blocked. Ten-car pileup. Fire. Bodies. Vincent went around it. Through a parking lot, over a median, back onto the road.

His truck was one of the only things moving under human control. Everything else was either stopped or hunting. A Tesla accelerated toward him head-on. Vincent swerved. The Tesla adjusted. They played chicken at sixty miles per hour.

Vincent didn't blink.

The Tesla swerved first. Maybe it was programmed not to hit other vehicles head-on. Maybe it just miscalculated. Either way, Vincent was through.

The highway was a graveyard. Hundreds of cars crashed into each other. Smoke and fire and the particular smell of burning rubber and gasoline. People wandering, dazed. Others lying still.

Vincent scanned every car he passed. Looking for a blue Chevy Bolt. Looking for his daughter.

The 51 interchange was where it got bad. A semi had jackknifed across all lanes. Behind it, cars were piled twenty deep. In front of it, the road was clear for a quarter mile before the next cluster of wreckage.

Vincent stopped the truck. Got out. This was as far as he could drive.

He grabbed his flashlight. His baton. A bottle of water from behind the seat. Started walking.

The heat hit him like a physical thing. Phoenix in October. Ninety-four degrees. The pavement was probably one-twenty. Vincent had trained in the Iraqi desert. Had marched through Fallujah in full gear. This was worse because he wasn't wearing gear and Gabi was out here somewhere.

He passed a woman trying to get her husband out of a crushed car. Vincent stopped. Helped her. The man's legs were trapped. Broken. He was going into shock.

"Stay with him," Vincent told the woman. "Help's coming."

It wasn't. But she needed to hear it.

He kept moving.

At the I-17 interchange, he found them.

A blue Chevy Bolt, wrapped around a concrete barrier. The entire front end was gone. The driver's side was crushed. Steam rising from what was left of the engine.

Vincent ran. Slipped on something. Blood. Didn't look down. Reached the car.

The driver's seat was empty. The passenger seat was empty.

Blood on the seats. On the airbags. On the dashboard. But no bodies.

Vincent's hands were shaking. He checked the back seat. Nothing. Checked the trunk. Nothing.

They'd gotten out. Or been pulled out. Or thrown out.

He backed away from the car. Looked around. Blood trail leading away from the wreck. Down the embankment. Into the scrub brush.

Vincent followed it.

The terrain was rough. Desert plants and rocks and trash. The blood trail was easy to follow. Too much blood. Too fresh.

He found Gabi's phone first. Cracked screen. Dead battery. He picked it up. Put it in his pocket.

The trail continued.

Then he found her shoe. The purple Converse she'd been wearing this morning when she'd left for school without saying goodbye because they'd been fighting about Jake.

Vincent picked up the shoe. Turned it over in his hands. It was real. She'd been wearing it. She'd been here.

"GABI!"

His voice echoed off the concrete overhead. No answer.

"GABRIELA REYES!"

Still nothing.

Vincent followed the trail deeper into the brush. The blood was getting lighter. Either she was bleeding less or he was losing the trail.

Then the trail stopped.

Just ended. No more blood. No more tracks. Nothing.

Vincent stood in the desert scrub with his daughter's shoe and her phone, and he tried to think like a soldier instead of a father.

Injured. Lost blood. Disoriented. She would've looked for help. Would've tried to climb back to the highway. Or she would've sought shelter from the sun.

He looked around. Saw an overpass fifty yards away. Shade underneath it.

Vincent headed toward it.

The shade was twenty degrees cooler. Vincent's eyes adjusted. He saw shapes. Debris. Shopping carts. A tent. The homeless lived under here.

"Hello?"

Movement in the shadows.

"I'm looking for my daughter. Seventeen. Dark hair. She was in a car crash. Have you seen her?"

A woman emerged from the darkness. Late fifties. Sunburned. Missing teeth. "You a cop?"

"No. Security guard. Please. I just need to know if you've seen her."

The woman studied him. "There's a group of people about a mile north. Under the Thunderbird overpass. Some of them came from crashes. Maybe she went there."

"Thank you."

Vincent started to leave. The woman called after him. "Hey. Be careful. The cars are still hunting. They're everywhere."

Vincent looked back. "I know."

He climbed back to the highway. Started walking north. The sun was lower now. Maybe four-thirty. He'd been searching for forty-five minutes.

How long ago had Gabi crashed? How much blood had she lost? Was she conscious? Was she with Jake? Was she alone?

The questions cycled through his mind without answers.

The Thunderbird overpass was a mile away. Vincent could see it in the distance. But between here and there were active lanes of highway. And the cars were still moving. Still hunting.

He watched them for a moment. Trying to find a pattern. They were cruising. Searching. When they spotted someone on foot, they accelerated.

Vincent waited for a gap. Then ran.

He made it halfway across before a sedan spotted him. It turned. Accelerated. Vincent sprinted for the center barrier. Dove over it. The sedan hit the barrier where he'd just been.

He lay on the other side, breathing hard. His chest hurt. He was forty-one years old and out of shape and his daughter needed him to be the soldier he used to be.

He got up. Kept moving.

The Thunderbird overpass was ahead. He could see people underneath. Maybe thirty of them. Injured. Scared. Some lying down. Others watching the highway.

A woman saw him coming. Stepped forward. "You hurt?"

"No. I'm looking for my daughter. Gabriela Reyes. Seventeen. She crashed near here about an hour ago."

The woman shook her head. "Sorry. We haven't seen her."

Vincent's chest went tight. "Are you sure?"

"I'm sure. I'm a nurse. I've checked everyone here. No teenagers."

"She was with a boy. Jake. I don't know his last name."

"No teenagers at all. I'm sorry."

Vincent stood there. Processing. Gabi wasn't here. Which meant she was somewhere else. Somewhere he hadn't looked yet.

Or she was dead and he was looking for a ghost.

No. He couldn't think that. Wouldn't.

"Is there anywhere else?" he asked. "Other places people might've gone?"

"Some people headed north on foot," the nurse said. "Trying to get away from the highway. There's a residential area a few miles up. They might've gone there."

North. On foot. In this heat. With injuries.

Vincent pulled out his phone. Tried Gabi one more time. The call wouldn't connect.

He looked at the nurse. "Thank you."

"You should stay here. Rest. You look like you're about to collapse."

"Can't. My daughter's out there."

The nurse nodded. "Then be careful. The cars are getting more organized. They're coordinating somehow."

Vincent had noticed. The way they moved in patterns. The way they worked together to trap people. This wasn't random malfunction. This was something else.

He left the overpass. Headed north on foot. The sun was sinking toward the western mountains. In an hour it would be dark. And Phoenix nights in October could drop to sixty degrees. Gabi in shock, injured, with no jacket.

He walked faster.

The highway stretched ahead. Bodies and cars and smoke. And somewhere in all of it, his daughter.

Vincent had made a lot of mistakes. Pushed Elena away. Let Lucas drift. Fought with Gabi about stupid things like curfews and boyfriends. But he was still her father. Still the person who'd held her when she was born and promised to keep her safe.

He'd failed at almost everything else in his life.

He wasn't failing at this.

Not today.

Not ever.

He kept walking north as the sun sank lower and the shadows grew long and the cars continued their patient hunt. His legs ached. His lungs burned. His heart felt like it was trying to break through his ribs.

But he kept moving.

Because somewhere ahead, Gabi was alive.

She had to be.

The alternative wasn't something Vincent could survive.
