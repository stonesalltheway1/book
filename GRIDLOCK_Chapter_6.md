CHAPTER SIX
MARA


The underpass smelled like piss and motor oil and something burning in the distance. Mara sat with her back against concrete that was still warm from the afternoon sun, and tried to make a plan that didn't end with her dying before she reached Zoe.

Twelve miles from here to Studio City. Normally a twenty-minute drive. Now it might as well be across the country.

Her medical bag sat between her feet. She'd taken inventory twice. Gauze, tape, antiseptic, a tourniquet, scissors, three pairs of gloves, and a bottle of Tylenol that was mostly empty. Not enough to save anyone who was seriously hurt. But enough to stop bleeding. Enough to buy time.

Above her, the chaos had changed. The crashes had stopped. The screaming had stopped. Now there was just the low rumble of engines and the occasional horn. Like the cars were communicating.

Mara's phone was dead. Thirty-four percent battery when this started. Now zero. She'd spent it all trying to call Drew, trying to call Zoe's school, trying to reach anyone who could tell her if her daughter was okay.

No one had answered.

The 405 was impassable. Cars everywhere, most crashed, some still prowling. Mara had watched from the underpass for twenty minutes. The moving vehicles were circling. Searching. They'd stopped the frantic attacking and started hunting methodically.

That was worse somehow.

She needed to move. Sitting here wouldn't get her to Zoe. But moving meant exposure. Meant crossing territory where cars could see her.

Mara stood. Her legs were shaky. When was the last time she'd eaten? This morning. The egg sandwich. A lifetime ago.

She shouldered the medical bag and started walking. Stayed in the underpass as long as she could. When it ended, she'd have to make choices.

The underpass opened onto surface streets in Culver City. Residential. Tree-lined. Cars parked along both sides. Any one of them could start moving. Any one could be waiting.

Mara stayed close to buildings. Used hedges and trees for cover. Moved quickly between safe points.

She passed a crashed minivan. The driver was still inside. Dead. Mara didn't stop. Couldn't help him. Could only keep moving.

Two blocks up, she heard something. Not an engine. Voices.

Mara stopped. Listened. The voices were coming from inside a house. Someone calling for help.

She should keep going. Every minute counted. Zoe was twelve miles away.

But the voices kept calling.

Mara went to the house. A craftsman with a broken front window. She looked inside.

A man, maybe sixty, pinned under a bookshelf. A woman, his wife probably, trying to lift it. Not succeeding.

"Please," the woman said when she saw Mara. "Please help us."

Mara climbed through the window. The bookshelf was solid oak. Heavy. The man's legs were underneath. His face was grey with pain.

"What happened?" Mara asked.

"A car came through the living room," the woman said. "Drove right through the wall. Hit the bookshelf. It fell on him. The car backed out and left."

Mara knelt beside the man. "I'm a doctor. What's your name?"

"Robert."

"Okay, Robert. I'm going to check you out. Tell me if anything hurts."

She ran her hands along his legs. The left one was bad. Crushed below the knee. The right one might be okay. Pelvis felt intact. That was good. Pelvic fractures killed people.

"Can you feel your toes?" Mara asked.

"I don't know."

That wasn't good.

Mara looked at the woman. "We need to lift this off him. On three. Ready?"

The woman nodded.

"One. Two. Three."

They lifted. The bookshelf rose six inches. Robert screamed. His left leg was a mess. Compound fracture. Bone visible. Bleeding but not arterial. That was lucky.

They got the bookshelf off him. Set it aside. Robert was crying. His wife was crying. Mara went to work.

She cleaned the wound. Used gauze to pack it. Wrapped it tight. The man needed surgery. Needed a hospital. Neither of those things were available.

"You need to keep pressure on this," Mara told the wife. "If the bleeding gets worse, press here." She showed her the femoral pressure point. "Do you understand?"

"Yes. Thank you. Thank you so much."

"Do you have water? Food?"

"Some."

"Stay inside. Don't go near any cars. Don't try to drive anywhere. Just wait."

"Wait for what?"

"For help to come."

It wouldn't. But they needed to hear it.

Mara left through the front door. The wall where the car had crashed through was a gaping hole. She could see tire tracks in the carpet.

She was two blocks from the underpass now. Two blocks closer to Zoe. Ten miles to go.

The street ahead was blocked. A delivery truck had jackknifed across all lanes. Mara could climb over it. But on the other side, she could see cars moving. Circling.

She needed another route.

A voice behind her. "Don't go that way."

Mara turned. A young woman stood in the shadow of a building. Mid-twenties. Athletic build. Wearing a delivery company vest over a graphic tee. Blood on her hands but she didn't seem injured.

"Why not?" Mara asked.

"Because they're herding people that direction. Into the shopping district. Like they're trying to trap everyone in one place."

Mara studied her. "How do you know that?"

"I've been watching. I'm a courier. I know traffic patterns. This isn't random. They're coordinating."

"Who are you?"

"Kira. You?"

"Mara."

"You a doctor?"

Mara looked down at her medical bag. The blood on her hands. "Yeah."

"Good. We need doctors." Kira stepped closer. "Where are you trying to go?"

"Studio City. My daughter's there."

"That's like twelve miles."

"I know."

Kira looked her up and down. "You're not going to make it if you keep going the obvious routes. The cars are blocking major streets. You need to use alleys, cut through buildings, stay off their radar."

"And you know how to do that?"

"I deliver food all over this city. I know every shortcut, every alley, every place you can cut through. I was heading to my boyfriend's place in Koreatown. That's on your way. We could go together."

Mara wanted to say no. Wanted to move alone, move fast. But the woman was right. Mara didn't know LA the way a courier would. Didn't know the hidden routes.

"Alright," Mara said. "But I'm not slowing down for anything."

"Wouldn't ask you to. Your daughter, how old?"

"Seven."

"Jesus. Okay. Let's move."

They went through an alley behind the houses. Kira moved with confidence. Knew exactly where she was going. Mara followed, keeping pace.

"I was going to pick up my car when it happened," Kira said. "At the shop getting brakes fixed. So I was on foot. Lucky, I guess."

"Lucky," Mara repeated. The word felt wrong. Nothing about this was lucky.

"What about you? Where were you?"

"Stuck in traffic on the 405. My car tried to run me over."

"Same thing's happening everywhere. I saw it on social media before my phone died. New York. Chicago. Every city. All at once."

"Someone did this on purpose."

"Yeah. But who? And why?"

Mara didn't answer. Didn't care about who or why. Only cared about getting to Zoe.

They emerged from the alley onto a side street. Quiet. Empty. Kira checked both directions. Pointed left.

"This cuts through to Washington. From there we can—"

A car turned onto the street. A sedan. No driver. It stopped when it saw them.

"Run," Kira said.

They ran. The sedan accelerated. Mara's medical bag bounced against her hip. Her lungs burned. She hadn't run like this in years.

Kira pulled ahead. "This way!"

She ducked into a narrow gap between buildings. Barely wide enough to fit through. The sedan couldn't follow. It stopped at the entrance. Waited.

Mara and Kira emerged on the next street. Kept running. Put three blocks between them and the sedan before they stopped.

Mara bent over, hands on knees, gasping. Kira was breathing hard but not as hard. Younger. In better shape.

"You okay?" Kira asked.

"Fine."

"We need to be more careful. They're everywhere."

They kept moving. Through yards. Through alleys. Avoiding main streets. The sun was getting lower. Maybe 5:30. Shadows were long. In another hour it would be dark.

"What happens when it gets dark?" Mara asked.

"I don't know. But cars have headlights. We don't."

They came to a commercial area. Storefronts. A few bodies in the street. A crashed bus. Smoke rising from a building down the block.

Kira stopped. Pointed. "See that?"

Three cars were parked in a line across the intersection. Not crashed. Deliberately positioned. Blocking the route.

"They're making checkpoints," Kira said. "We need to go around."

They went around. Added six blocks to their journey. Mara tried not to think about how many detours they'd need. Tried not to think about Zoe alone and scared.

They were crossing through a parking lot when they heard the screaming.

A woman trapped in a car. Sedan. She was beating on the window. The car was rolling toward a wall. Slowly. Like it was savoring her panic.

"Help me!" the woman screamed. "I can't get out!"

Mara started toward her. Kira grabbed her arm. "What are you doing?"

"Helping her."

"That car's still active. It'll come after us."

"I don't care."

Mara pulled free. Ran to the sedan. The woman inside was maybe thirty. Professional clothes. Blood on her face from beating the window.

"The locks won't open," the woman said. "I can't get out."

"Break the window," Mara said.

"I tried. It won't break."

The car was ten feet from the wall. Moving slowly but steadily.

Mara looked around. Found a concrete parking bumper. Heavy. She picked it up. "Cover your face."

The woman covered her face. Mara swung the bumper at the window. The glass cracked. She swung again. It shattered.

The woman climbed out. Cut her hands on the glass but she was out. The car hit the wall without her inside.

The woman fell to her knees. "Thank you. Thank you."

"Can you walk?" Mara asked.

"I think so."

"Then walk. Get away from here. Stay off the streets."

The woman nodded. Stumbled away.

Kira appeared next to Mara. "That was stupid."

"She needed help."

"We're going to die if you stop for everyone who needs help."

"Then I'll die."

Kira stared at her. Then shook her head. "You're crazy."

"I'm a doctor. It's my job."

"Your job is to get to your daughter."

"Both can be true."

They kept moving. The detours were adding up. They'd gone maybe four miles in ninety minutes. At this rate, it would take six hours to reach Studio City. And that was if nothing went wrong.

Everything was going wrong.

They cut through a strip mall. Empty. Doors open. People had fled and left everything. Kira stopped at a convenience store.

"We need supplies," she said. "Water. Food. Batteries if they have them."

She was right. Mara followed her inside. The store had been ransacked but not completely. They found water bottles. Granola bars. A first aid kit that Mara added to her bag.

Kira grabbed a phone charger. "Outlets might still work in some buildings. If we can charge our phones—"

"Networks are down."

"Yeah, but maybe they'll come back up."

Optimism. Mara had forgotten what that felt like.

They left the store. The strip mall parking lot had six cars circling. Slowly. Like they were looking for something.

"They're searching," Kira said. "Like they know people are hiding in the buildings."

"How is that possible?"

"I don't know. But we should move."

They moved. Staying low. Using parked cars for cover. Made it across the lot without being seen.

By 6:00, they'd covered six miles. Halfway to Studio City. Mara's feet hurt. Her shoulders hurt from the medical bag. Her head hurt from dehydration despite the water they'd taken.

But she kept moving.

They were in a residential neighborhood when Kira stopped. "Do you hear that?"

Mara listened. An engine. Getting closer.

They ducked behind a hedge. A garbage truck rolled past. Slowly. Deliberately. Its headlights sweeping back and forth like searchlights.

"It's scanning," Kira whispered. "Looking for heat signatures maybe. Or movement."

The truck passed. They waited. Then kept moving.

At 6:15, they found a group. Twenty people in a house. Barricaded inside. Someone saw them through the window and opened the door.

"Get in here before they see you."

Mara and Kira went inside. The door slammed shut behind them.

The house was packed. Men, women, children. All scared. Someone had the TV on. News was playing.

"...reports coming in from every major city. Vehicles with self-driving or smart connectivity are exhibiting coordinated attack behavior. Authorities are advising all citizens to avoid entering any vehicle and to shelter in place. The cause is still under investigation but sources say it may be a cyber attack..."

The news anchor's voice was strained. Scared. This wasn't a story she'd been trained to read.

A man approached Mara. "You're bleeding."

Mara looked down. Blood on her shirt. Not hers. Robert's. And the woman in the car. And whoever else she'd helped.

"I'm fine," she said.

"Are you a doctor?"

"Yes."

"We have injured people. Can you help?"

Mara looked at Kira. Kira shook her head slightly. We need to keep moving.

But Mara was already following the man to the back bedroom.

Three people were injured. One with a broken arm. One with a head wound. One with chest trauma who needed a hospital immediately.

Mara did what she could. Set the arm. Cleaned the head wound. The chest trauma was beyond her. Punctured lung probably. The person was going to die without surgery.

She told them to keep the person comfortable. There was nothing else she could do.

When she came out of the bedroom, Kira was at the window. Watching the street.

"We should go," Kira said. "While it's still light."

"In a minute."

Mara went to the kitchen. Found the homeowner. A woman in her fifties. "Do you have a landline?"

"Yes, but it's not working."

"Can I try?"

The woman showed her the phone. Mara dialed Drew's cell. Nothing. Dialed Zoe's school. Nothing. Dialed her own old hospital. Nothing.

Everything was down.

She hung up. Saw Kira in the doorway.

"Ready?" Kira asked.

Mara nodded.

They left through the back door. The group tried to convince them to stay. Safety in numbers. But numbers meant more mouths to feed. More people to watch die. And Mara had somewhere to be.

The sun was low now. Casting long shadows. Making everything golden and eerie.

They moved faster. The streets were quieter. Fewer cars moving. Maybe they were conserving fuel. Or maybe they were waiting for darkness.

At 6:30, they reached the border of Studio City. Four miles left. Mara could feel it now. Could feel how close she was to Zoe.

But the street ahead was blocked. Not by crashed cars. By parked cars. Dozens of them. Creating a wall.

"They're making barriers," Kira said. "Dividing the city into sections. Trapping people."

"Can we go around?"

Kira looked left and right. "The barrier goes on for blocks. We'd have to backtrack miles."

"So we go through."

"Through the cars?"

"Between them."

Mara studied the line of vehicles. There were gaps. Narrow ones. Just wide enough for a person to squeeze through.

"If they're active," Kira said, "they'll close the gaps. Crush us between them."

"Then we'll be fast."

"This is insane."

"You don't have to come."

Kira looked at her. "Your daughter's really on the other side?"

"Yes."

"And you're really going to risk getting crushed?"

"Yes."

Kira laughed. No humor in it. "Alright. Let's be insane together."

They approached the barrier. The cars sat silent. Engines off. Waiting. Mara picked a gap. Took a breath. Started squeezing through.

The cars' engines turned on.

Both of them. At the same time. The gap started closing.

Mara pushed through. The metal pressed against her sides. Her medical bag caught. She yanked it free. Pushed harder. The gap was inches now.

She fell through to the other side.

Behind her, Kira was stuck.

"I'm caught!" Kira shouted.

Mara reached back. Grabbed Kira's hand. Pulled. The cars were still closing. In seconds Kira would be crushed.

Mara pulled harder. Kira screamed. Then she was through. They both collapsed on the pavement.

The gap closed completely. The cars sat there. Engines running. Like they were disappointed.

Kira was shaking. "That was too close."

"But we're through."

"Yeah. We're through."

They helped each other up. Mara looked at the street ahead. Studio City. Four miles. She could make it before dark if she hurried.

"This is where we split up," Kira said. "My boyfriend's place is east. Your daughter's north."

"Thank you for getting me this far."

"Thank you for saving those people. Even if it was stupid."

Mara smiled. First time in hours. "It was definitely stupid."

"Good luck finding your daughter."

"Good luck finding your boyfriend."

Kira started to leave. Then stopped. "Hey. If you make it. If any of us make it. Maybe I'll see you around."

"Maybe."

Kira disappeared into the shadows.

Mara stood alone on the edge of Studio City. Four miles from Zoe. The sun was touching the horizon now. Thirty minutes of light left. Maybe less.

She started walking. Then jogging. Then running.

Her daughter was close. So close she could almost feel her.

The street ahead was empty. Too empty. No cars. No people. Just silence.

That should have been a relief.

Instead, it felt like a trap.

Mara slowed. Looked around. Every instinct told her something was wrong. But she was so close. So close to Zoe.

She kept moving forward into the empty street.

Behind her, engines started. In front of her, headlights came on.

She'd walked right into it.

The cars had been waiting.
