CHAPTER FIFTEEN
VINCENT

Downtown Phoenix burned.

Vincent stood at the edge of it, bike between his legs, and watched the city destroy itself. Fires on three blocks. Smoke rising into the night sky. And everywhere, headlights. Moving in patterns. Organized. Patient.

The Renaissance Center was ahead. Sixteen floors of glass and steel. Elena's office was there. Sixteenth floor. Keller & Associates. He'd been there once, years ago. Anniversary dinner. Before everything broke.

But Gabi wasn't there. Jake had said she was looking for her mom. And Elena worked downtown. But the convention center was where FEMA had set up. Where people would go. Where Gabi would go if she was looking for safety.

Vincent pedaled toward the convention center. Three miles through downtown. Through the warzone.

The streets were chaos. Crashed cars everywhere. Bodies. Fires. And through it all, the vehicles moved. Not randomly. In coordinated sweeps. Like they were searching. Like they were herding.

Vincent stayed off main streets. Used alleys. Cut through parking lots. The bike was quiet. Fast. He could move between the cars' patrols. Stay ahead of them.

A parking garage ahead. Concrete structure. Five levels. Someone had barricaded the entrance. Cars pushed into position. Creating a barrier.

Vincent slowed. Studied it. Movement on the upper levels. Flashlights. People.

A voice called down. "Who are you?"

"Vincent Reyes. I'm looking for my daughter."

"Are you alone?"

"Yeah."

"Are you armed?"

Vincent's hand went to the Glock. "Yeah."

"Come up. Slowly. Hands visible."

Vincent got off the bike. Pushed it into the garage. Climbed the ramp to the second level. Hands up. The Glock visible in his waistband.

Three people waited. Two men, one woman. All armed. All tired. All scared.

"Who's in charge?" Vincent asked.

"Me." A man stepped forward. Forties. Hispanic. Military bearing. "Cortez. Former Marine."

"Vincent Reyes. Army. Four years."

Cortez nodded. "What unit?"

"First Infantry. Fallujah."

"Semper Fi, brother. What brings you downtown?"

"My daughter. Seventeen. She was in a car crash on the 101. I think she came here looking for her mother."

"Lots of people came here. FEMA set up at the convention center. Thousands of people. But the cars surrounded it. No one can get in or out."

"Have you seen a teenage girl? Dark hair. Five foot six. Name's Gabriela."

Cortez shook his head. "Haven't seen her. But we've been here for hours. People came through. Some stayed. Some moved on. Your daughter might've been one of them."

"Where did they go?"

"Convention center. Or tried to. Most didn't make it. The cars are everywhere. They've been herding people. Pushing them toward the center. Like they want everyone in one place."

Vincent's chest tightened. "Why?"

"Don't know. But it's not random. They're organized. Coordinated. They adapt. We've been fighting them. Molotovs. Tire spikes. It works for a while. Then they learn. Change tactics. Come at us differently."

"Show me."

Cortez led him deeper into the garage. More people. Maybe thirty. Huddled in groups. Supplies stacked. Makeshift barricades. They'd been here for hours. Fighting. Surviving.

"See that?" Cortez pointed to the street below. A sedan sat at the intersection. Engine running. Headlights off. "It's been there for an hour. Just watching. Not moving. Not attacking. Just... waiting."

"For what?"

"Us to make a mistake. To try to leave. To get desperate."

Vincent studied the car. It was patient. Organized. Like all of them. But this one felt different. More focused. Like it was tracking something specific.

"Has anyone tried to reach the convention center?" Vincent asked.

"Three groups. None came back."

"How long ago?"

"Last group left two hours ago. Haven't heard from them since."

Vincent looked toward the convention center. Three blocks away. Massive building. And surrounding it, hundreds of vehicles. Circling. Waiting. Like sharks around a kill.

"I need to get there," Vincent said.

"You'll die."

"Maybe. But my daughter's in there. Or she's trying to get there. I can't just sit here."

Cortez studied him. "You're serious."

"Yeah."

"Then I'll go with you."

"You don't have to."

"I know. But I've been sitting here for hours. Watching people die. Doing nothing. I'm tired of doing nothing."

Vincent looked at the other people in the garage. "What about them?"

"They'll be fine. They know how to defend this position. But if we can get to the convention center, if we can find a way in, maybe we can help more people."

Vincent nodded. "Alright. But we move fast. Stay low. Use cover."

"Marine tactics. I know."

They gathered supplies. Water. Food. Ammunition. Vincent checked the Glock. Full magazine. Fifteen rounds. Not much against cars. But it might buy them time.

They left through the back of the garage. Down a service ramp. Into an alley. The convention center was ahead. Three blocks. Through enemy territory.

They moved fast. Staying close to buildings. Using dumpsters and parked cars for cover. The cars prowled the streets. Headlights sweeping. Searching.

At the first intersection, a sedan spotted them. Headlights flashed. Engine revved. It accelerated.

Vincent and Cortez dove behind a dumpster. The sedan hit it. Metal screaming. The dumpster rocked but held.

The sedan backed up. Circled. Looking for them.

Vincent aimed the Glock. Fired three shots. The windshield spiderwebbed. The sedan stopped. Backed away. But it didn't leave. Just repositioned. Waiting.

"They learn," Cortez said. "See? They adapt."

They kept moving. Two more blocks. The convention center loomed ahead. Massive. And surrounding it, the vehicles. Dozens. Maybe hundreds. All circling. All waiting.

Vincent studied the pattern. Looking for gaps. Weaknesses. Anything.

"There," he said. Pointing. "The loading dock. On the west side. The cars aren't as thick there."

"Why?"

"Don't know. But it's our best shot."

They moved toward it. Staying low. Using cover. The cars were everywhere. But they were focused on the main entrances. The loading dock was secondary. Less defended.

They reached it. Concrete ramp. Steel doors. No cars directly in front of it. But they were close. Circling. Watching.

Vincent tried the door. Locked.

"Can you pick it?" Cortez asked.

Vincent examined the lock. Standard commercial. He could pick it. But it would take time. And the cars were getting closer.

A sound behind them. Engine. Getting louder.

They pressed against the door. A pickup truck rolled past. Slowly. Deliberately. Its headlights swept the loading dock. Missed them by inches.

The truck kept going. Didn't stop. Didn't turn back.

"They didn't see us," Cortez whispered.

"Or they're letting us get closer."

Vincent went back to the lock. Picked it. Took thirty seconds. The lock clicked. The door opened.

They slipped inside. Pulled the door shut behind them.

Dark. Empty. Storage area. Boxes stacked. Forklifts parked. The convention center's loading dock.

They moved deeper. Found a door. Opened it. Corridor. Emergency lights. Red glow.

Voices ahead. Many voices. Hundreds. Maybe thousands.

They followed the sound. Through corridors. Past storage rooms. Into the main convention hall.

The hall was massive. Football field sized. And it was full of people. Thousands of them. Sitting. Standing. Huddled in groups. Families. Individuals. All trapped. All scared.

Vincent scanned faces. Looking for Gabi. Looking for Elena. Looking for anyone familiar.

"Where do we start?" Cortez asked.

"The medical area. If there is one. Or the command center. Somewhere organized. That's where Elena would be. She's a paralegal. She'd help organize."

They moved through the crowd. People watched them pass. Some asked for help. Some asked for news. Vincent kept moving. Focused. Looking.

They found a medical station. Makeshift. Tables set up. People treating injuries. And there, in the middle of it, was Elena.

She was helping a woman. Bandaging a wound. Her hands moved with practiced efficiency. She'd always been good in a crisis. Better than Vincent. Calmer. More capable.

"Elena."

She looked up. Her face went through the same sequence Vincent had seen on a hundred faces today. Confusion. Recognition. Disbelief.

"Vincent? What are you doing here?"

"Looking for Gabi. Is she here?"

Elena's face fell. "She was. Last night. She came in with a group. Scared. Hurt. But she ran off this morning. When I tried to check her injuries. She didn't want to see me. Or you."

"Where did she go?"

"I don't know. She just... left. Disappeared into the crowd. I've been looking for her. But there are thousands of people here. I can't find her."

Vincent's chest went tight. Gabi was here. Had been here. But now she was gone. Lost in a sea of people.

"Did she say anything? Give you any clue where she was going?"

"She said she didn't need us. That she could take care of herself. That we'd both abandoned her and she was better off alone."

The words hit like punches. Each one landing. Each one true.

"We need to find her," Vincent said.

"How? There are thousands of people here. And the cars are outside. We can't leave. We're trapped."

Vincent looked around. At the crowd. At the fear. At the desperation.

"We'll find her," he said. "We have to."

Cortez stepped forward. "I can help. I know some people here. We can organize a search. Ask around. Someone's seen her."

Elena looked at Cortez. "Who are you?"

"Cortez. I came with Vincent. We're trying to help."

Elena studied him. Then nodded. "Alright. But we need to be careful. People are scared. Some are dangerous. Desperate people do desperate things."

They started searching. Moving through the crowd. Asking. Showing descriptions. Most people hadn't seen Gabi. But a few had. A girl matching her description. Dark hair. Scared. Alone.

"She was heading toward the food distribution area," one man said. "Maybe an hour ago."

They went there. Found more people. More chaos. But no Gabi.

"She was asking about Jake," a woman said. "The boy she was with in the crash. She wanted to know if he was here."

They searched the medical areas. Found Jake. Lying on a cot. Bandaged. Bruised. But alive.

"Jake," Vincent said.

The boy's eyes opened. Focused. "Mr. Reyes?"

"Where's Gabi?"

"She was here. This morning. But she left. Said she was going to find a way out. That she wasn't staying trapped here."

"Did she say where?"

"No. But she was talking to some people. A group. They said they knew a way out. Through the underground. Maintenance tunnels. She went with them."

Vincent's heart sank. Gabi had left. Gone into the tunnels. Alone. Or with strangers.

"When?"

"Maybe two hours ago."

Two hours. She could be anywhere. In the tunnels. Outside. Dead.

"We need to find those tunnels," Vincent said.

Cortez nodded. "I'll ask around. Someone knows where they are."

They searched. Asked. Found someone who knew. A maintenance worker. He showed them the entrance. Basement level. Behind a storage room. Hidden.

"The tunnels connect to other buildings," the worker said. "People have been using them to move around. But it's dangerous. The cars know about them. They've been blocking exits. Trapping people inside."

Vincent looked at the tunnel entrance. Dark. Narrow. Dangerous.

But Gabi was in there. Somewhere.

"I'm going in," he said.

"I'm coming with you," Elena said.

"No. Stay here. It's safer."

"Gabi's my daughter too. I'm not staying here while you go after her."

Vincent looked at her. At the determination in her eyes. The same determination that had kept them together for nineteen years. And the same determination that had driven them apart.

"Alright," he said. "But stay close. And if I tell you to run, you run."

"I can take care of myself."

"I know you can."

Cortez stepped forward. "I'll stay here. Coordinate the search. If you find her, bring her back. If you don't... come back anyway. We'll figure something else out."

Vincent nodded. Checked the Glock. Checked his supplies. Then he and Elena entered the tunnel.

Dark. Cold. The sound of their breathing echoing off concrete walls.

Somewhere ahead, Gabi was waiting.

Or she wasn't.

But Vincent would find out.

One way or another.

He'd find out.
