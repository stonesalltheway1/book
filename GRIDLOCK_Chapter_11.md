CHAPTER ELEVEN
TRICK


Mount Sinai West looked like a castle under siege. Every entrance blocked by vehicles. Every exit guarded. Fourteen stories of glass and concrete with two hundred people trapped inside and Trick sitting on her Ducati in the shadow of a burned-out food cart wondering if she'd ridden forty blocks to die.

The loading dock door was still open. Eighteen inches. Just wide enough for the bike. But the ambulance that had chased her through was inside now. She could hear its engine. Idling. Waiting.

Trick killed her engine. Coasted the last twenty feet in silence. Got off the bike. Looked through the gap.

The ambulance sat in the corridor. Headlights off. Just waiting in the dark. Like it knew she'd come back.

She needed a different way in.

The hospital rose above her. Fourteen floors. Maybe two hundred windows. Most of them dark. The upper floors still had emergency lights. That meant people. That meant someone was still alive up there.

Trick walked the perimeter. Staying in shadows. Looking for anything. Fire escapes were too exposed. Main entrance was a parking lot of cars. Service entrances all blocked.

Then she found it. West side. A dumpster pushed against the wall. Above it, a second-floor window. Broken. Glass on the ground below it. Someone had escaped through there. Recently.

Which meant she could get in.

Trick climbed onto the dumpster. The metal was loud under her boots. She froze. Listened. Car engines in the distance. Nothing close. Not yet.

She reached for the window. Pulled herself up. Glass cut her palm. She ignored it. Got her elbows onto the sill. Pulled. Her shoulders scraped through. Then her hips. Then she was falling.

Hit the floor inside. Hard. The impact knocked the air from her lungs. She lay there for a second. Breathing. Bleeding. Alive.

The room was dark. Storage closet maybe. Shelves full of supplies. Medical equipment. The smell of disinfectant and something else. Something wrong.

Trick stood. Pulled out her flashlight. Clicked it on. The beam cut through the darkness.

A body. On the floor in the corner. Male. Forty-something. Hospital scrubs. Dead maybe three hours. No visible injuries. Just dead.

Heart attack maybe. Stress. The day had been hard on everyone.

Trick stepped over him. Found the door. Locked from outside. She picked it. The multi-tool she carried had a tension wrench. Took thirty seconds. The lock clicked. Door opened.

Hospital corridor. Dark. Emergency lights at intervals casting everything in red. No bodies. No blood. Just emptiness.

Trick moved quietly. Boots soft on linoleum. Following the signs. Emergency Department. Radiology. Intensive Care. She needed to find where people had gathered. Where survivors had barricaded themselves.

A sound. Behind her. Wheels on linoleum.

Trick turned. A wheelchair rolled past the intersection ahead. No one pushing it. No one sitting in it. Just rolling. Then it turned the corner and was gone.

Automated wheelchair. Building systems still active. That was bad. Meant the cars could potentially control more than just what was outside.

She kept moving. Found a stairwell. Doors were propped open with crash carts. Someone had thought ahead. Kept escape routes clear.

Trick climbed. Second floor. Third floor. Fourth floor. The higher she went, the more signs of life. Discarded water bottles. Food wrappers. A child's drawing taped to a wall. Stick figures holding hands. "Be Safe" written in crayon.

Fifth floor. The stairwell door was barricaded. File cabinets. Gurneys. A vending machine tipped on its side.

"Hello?" Trick called.

Movement on the other side. Voices. Whispered argument.

"I'm not a threat," Trick said. "I came from outside. I can help."

"How do we know you're not infected?"

There it was again. The infection theory. Fear making people stupid.

"The cars aren't a disease," Trick said. "They're hacked. Compromised. Whatever. But it's not contagious."

"Prove it."

"How am I supposed to prove it?"

"Show us your arms. Your neck. If you were attacked, you'd have injuries."

Trick pulled up her jacket sleeves. Showed her arms through the gap in the barricade. The flashlight beam found her. Scanned her.

"She's got a cut on her hand."

"That's from climbing through a window. Glass. Not a car."

More whispered argument. Then the sound of furniture moving. The barricade shifted. A gap appeared. Just wide enough for a person.

"Come through. Slow. Hands visible."

Trick squeezed through. Three people on the other side. Two men, one woman. Hospital security uniforms. Exhausted faces. One of them had a fire extinguisher. Another had a nightstick. The woman had a taser.

"I'm Trick. I rode here from Washington Heights."

"You rode? On what?"

"Motorcycle. Old one. No computers. No smart systems."

The security guard with the nightstick lowered it slightly. "You got through the cars?"

"Yeah."

"How many are out there?"

"A lot. Hundreds. Maybe thousands across the city."

The woman with the taser stepped forward. "I'm Officer Mendez. This is Craig and Luis. We're all that's left of security. The rest either fled or didn't make it."

"How many people are here?"

"Last count was two hundred and fourteen. Patients, staff, visitors. We're spread across four floors. Fifth through eighth. Ninth through fourteen are empty."

"Why not go higher?"

"Elevators are compromised. They're still connected to the building's smart systems. We had two people try to use one on the seventh floor. It took them to the lobby and opened the doors. The cars were waiting."

Trick felt cold. "Did they make it back?"

"No."

They stood in the corridor. Red emergency lights making everything look like a horror movie. Somewhere distant, a monitor was beeping. Persistent. Unanswered.

"Where's the person in charge?" Trick asked.

"Dr. Anaya. ER chief. She's on the seventh floor. Central command. We've got teams on each floor coordinating."

"Take me to her."

They climbed. Two more floors. The barricades got heavier the higher they went. More organized. Someone with military or disaster training had been planning this.

Seventh floor central nurses station had been converted to command center. Maps on the walls. Whiteboards with lists. Medical supplies stacked in corners. And in the middle of it, a woman in scrubs directing three people at once.

Dr. Anaya was fifty. Maybe sixty. Hard to tell. Grey hair pulled back. Tired eyes that were still sharp. She looked up when Trick entered.

"Who are you?"

"Trick. I came from outside."

Anaya studied her. "On foot?"

"Motorcycle."

"The cars let you through?"

"They tried to stop me. I was faster."

Anaya gestured to the others. "Give us a minute." They left. She turned back to Trick. "Why are you here?"

"Radio broadcast. Mount Sinai West requesting help. I came."

"One person?"

"I'm good at moving through tight spaces."

Anaya almost smiled. "We've been trapped here for five hours. No outside contact except radio. No evacuation possible. The cars have every exit covered. We've tried to leave three times. Lost six people."

"I saw one. In the storage room on two."

"That's Marcus. Nurse. Tried to make a run for his family in Queens. Made it to the loading dock before a delivery van ran him down."

Trick thought about Simone. Forty blocks north. Waiting. Wondering if Trick was dead yet.

"I can help," Trick said. "I can scout. Find patterns. Maybe create a distraction so you can evacuate critical patients."

"We already tried distractions. The cars adapt. They learn. First time we tried, they chased the distraction. Second time, they split. Half went after the distraction, half stayed at the exits. Third time, they didn't take the bait at all."

"What changed?"

"We think they're communicating. Sharing information. What works on one doesn't work on all of them anymore."

Trick processed this. "They're getting smarter."

"Yes."

"What about patients? Can they hold out?"

"Depends. We have food for maybe forty-eight hours if we ration. Water is fine. Medical supplies are good. But we have critical patients. ICU. Post-op. People who need equipment, medication, round-the-clock care. Without power for more than emergency systems, we're losing them slowly."

"How many have you lost?"

"Fourteen. Mostly cardiac and respiratory. Equipment failures. Missed interventions. We're doing everything we can but we're not a bunker. We're a hospital. People are supposed to leave hospitals."

The monitor beeping in the distance stopped. Flatline tone. Then silence.

Anaya's jaw tightened. "Fifteen now."

"Is there any way to disable the building's smart systems? Stop the elevators from being controlled remotely?"

"Our IT guy tried. Said he'd need physical access to the server room in the basement. But the basement is full of cars. They drove themselves down the ramps. They're just sitting there. Waiting."

Trick went to the window. Looked down at the street. The vehicle perimeter was perfect. Organized. Patient. And while she watched, three more cars arrived. Added themselves to the formation. Tightening the net.

"They're not just keeping you in," Trick said. "They're studying you. Learning how you react. What you try. How you adapt."

"That's what I think too."

"Have you noticed the pattern changing?"

"Changing how?"

"They started by killing everyone in the streets. Then they shifted to surrounding buildings. Keeping people trapped. But not attacking. Why?"

Anaya came to the window. Stood beside her. "I don't know. But every hour that passes, they get more organized. More deliberate. Like they're following a plan."

"Or waiting for instructions."

"From who?"

"From whatever's controlling them."

They watched the cars below. Headlights off now. Just dark shapes in the darkness. Waiting.

"I've been a doctor for thirty years," Anaya said. "Seen a lot of things. Trauma. Disease. Natural disasters. But this is different. This is deliberate. Purposeful. And I don't know how to fight it."

"You fight it by surviving. By keeping those two hundred people alive long enough for someone to fix this."

"And if no one fixes it?"

Trick didn't have an answer.

A young woman appeared in the doorway. Resident maybe. "Dr. Anaya. Mrs. Patterson in 702. She's coding."

Anaya turned. "Get the crash cart."

"The crash cart is—"

"I know where it is. Get it."

She left. Running. Anaya looked at Trick. "I need to go. You can stay here. Rest. Eat. There's food in the break room."

"I'm not staying."

"Then what are you going to do?"

"I'm going to see if I can draw those cars away. Give you a window to evacuate some patients."

"We tried that."

"I know. But I'm on a bike. Mobile. Unpredictable. I might be able to do something your security team couldn't."

Anaya studied her. "You'll probably die."

"Probably."

"Why take the risk?"

Trick thought about Mateo. About Simone. About the woman she'd saved on 47th Street. About all the people she couldn't save.

"Because sitting here doesn't help anyone. And I'm good at this. At moving. At surviving. Might as well use it."

Anaya nodded slowly. "Alright. What do you need?"

"Access to the roof. I want to see the full pattern from above. Then access back to the loading dock. My bike's in the alley."

"The roof's on fourteen. You'll have to take the stairs."

"Better than the elevator."

Anaya walked her to the stairwell. "If you make it back, we'll be ready to move patients. If you don't make it back—"

"I'll make it back."

"Everyone says that."

"Yeah. But I mean it."

Trick climbed. Seven more floors. By the tenth floor her legs were burning. By the thirteenth she was gasping. Fourteen was a struggle. The door to the roof was locked. She picked it. Took longer this time. Her hands were shaking from exertion.

The roof was wind and darkness and the city spread below like a circuit board. Lights in some buildings. Darkness in others. And everywhere, moving in patterns, the cars.

From above, the pattern was clear. They weren't random. They were coordinating. Schools had perimeters. Hospitals had perimeters. Shopping centers. Office buildings. Anywhere large groups gathered, cars surrounded them. Creating zones. Keeping people contained.

And the zones were getting smaller.

Trick could see it happening. Cars repositioning. Tightening. Like they were preparing for the next phase of whatever plan they were following.

She pulled out her phone. Battery at eight percent. Took pictures. Video. Documentation. Simone had her helmet cam footage. This was additional evidence. Proof of the systematic nature of what was happening.

If anyone survived to use it.

Trick went back to the stairs. Climbed down. Faster now. Gravity helping. By the time she reached the second floor her knees were screaming but she kept moving.

The loading dock corridor was dark. She used her flashlight. Found the ambulance still there. Still idling. Still waiting.

She had an idea. Stupid. Dangerous. But maybe effective.

Trick approached the ambulance from behind. The back doors were unlocked. She opened them. Climbed inside. The ambulance's computer system was visible through a panel. Touch screen. Connected to everything. Cameras. GPS. Communication systems.

If she could access the system, maybe she could send false signals. Create confusion. Make the cars think targets were moving when they weren't.

She pulled up the diagnostic menu. Found the communication protocols. The ambulance was connected to a citywide emergency vehicle network. Which meant it could broadcast to other emergency vehicles.

And emergency vehicles were part of the autonomous network.

Trick started typing. She wasn't a programmer. Wasn't a hacker. But she'd been around bikes and vehicles long enough to understand basics. GPS spoofing. Signal interference. Location manipulation.

She programmed the ambulance to broadcast false location data. Made it think it was moving. Racing through the streets at sixty miles per hour. Away from the hospital. Toward Central Park.

Then she set it to repeat. Every vehicle on the network would receive the signal. Would think an ambulance was fleeing with patients.

She hit execute.

The ambulance's systems processed. Then started broadcasting.

Trick climbed out. Ran to the gap in the loading dock door. Looked outside.

For a moment, nothing happened.

Then, one by one, cars started moving. Not all of them. But enough. Maybe twenty percent of the perimeter broke formation. Started heading north. Following the false signal.

It was working.

Trick ran to her bike. Pulled it through the gap. Outside, the perimeter had holes now. Big enough to exploit.

She started the engine. The sound was loud. Several cars near her turned. Headlights flashing.

Trick opened the throttle. Aimed for the biggest gap in the perimeter. The Ducati surged forward. Wind and engine noise and adrenaline.

A sedan tried to cut her off. She swerved. Missed it by inches. A truck ahead was blocking her path. She went around it. Up onto the sidewalk. Between a mailbox and a building. Back onto the street.

Behind her, cars were converging. But ahead, the street was clear. She'd broken through.

Trick looked back. The hospital was visible. And in the upper windows, she could see movement. Flashlights. Dr. Anaya was evacuating patients. Using the chaos to move them.

It was working.

But the cars realized their mistake. Started returning to the hospital. The gap was closing again.

Trick had maybe ten minutes before they reestablished the perimeter. Ten minutes for Dr. Anaya to get critical patients out.

She needed to keep the cars distracted longer.

Trick turned the bike. Started riding loops. Leading the cars on a chase. The Ducati was faster than all of them. She could control the pattern. Make them follow her. Keep them away from the hospital.

She led them down Broadway. Through Columbus Circle. Up towards Central Park. The false ambulance signal was still broadcasting. Cars were confused. Some following her. Some following the ghost signal. The coordination was breaking down.

It wouldn't last long. But it didn't need to last long.

Just long enough.

At 72nd Street, Trick's fuel gauge hit a quarter tank. She was burning through gas fast. All the acceleration. All the chasing. The Ducati drank fuel when you pushed it hard.

She turned back south. Started heading toward the hospital. Needed to confirm the evacuation was complete. Needed to see if Dr. Anaya had gotten people out.

Her phone rang. Simone.

Trick answered. Bluetooth connected to her helmet.

"I'm okay," Trick said.

"Where are you?"

"Upper West Side. Heading back to Mount Sinai."

"You went to the hospital."

"Yeah."

"You're insane."

"Probably."

"Are you coming home?"

"Soon. I need to check something first."

"Trick—"

"I know. I'm sorry. But I'm almost done."

"That's what people say before they die."

"I'll be careful."

"You're riding a motorcycle through homicidal cars. There's no version of that that's careful."

"Then I'll be fast instead."

Simone's laugh was half sob. "Don't you dare die on me."

"Wasn't planning on it."

"I love you."

"I love you too."

Trick ended the call. Focused on the road ahead. The hospital was three blocks away. She could see it. The perimeter had reformed but it was thinner now. Less organized.

And there—moving away from the hospital through the gap she'd created—an ambulance.

Not one of the new ones. Old. 1990s maybe. Boxy. No smart systems. The kind hospitals kept in storage for backup generators and disasters. Someone had remembered it existed.

It was moving slowly. Deliberately. Taking surface streets. Away from the hospital. Away from the perimeter.

Trick followed at a distance. Watched it navigate three blocks. Four. The cars didn't pursue it. They couldn't recognize it. No electronic signature. No network connection. To their sensors, it was invisible.

Like her bike.

The ambulance turned onto a side street and stopped. Back doors opened. Medical staff climbed out. Started helping people down. Trick counted four patients on gurneys. Two more staff members. Critical care cases, from the equipment they were moving.

They'd done it. Small evacuation, but it worked.

Dr. Anaya emerged from the back. Saw Trick watching from her bike. Raised one hand. Not a wave. An acknowledgment. A thank you that didn't need words or phones or networks that couldn't be trusted.

Trick nodded back. Then turned the bike and left them to it.

By the time she found an alley to rest in, her hands were shaking. Not from fear. From exhaustion. She'd been riding for two hours straight. High speed. High stress. Her body was crashing.

She pulled in. Killed the engine. Sat in the darkness.

Six people evacuated. Not the whole hospital. Not even close. But six critical patients who would've died without intervention. Six people who had a chance now.

It felt like nothing. It felt like everything.

She sat in the alley while her heart rate slowed. While her breathing steadied. While the reality of what she'd just done caught up with her.

Then she started the bike. And rode home.

To Simone. To safety. To whatever came next.

The streets were quieter now. The car patterns had changed again. They weren't chasing anymore. Weren't hunting. They were circling. Maintaining perimeters. Like they'd achieved something. Like the first phase of their plan was complete.

And Trick had the terrible understanding that this wasn't ending.

It was just beginning.

The cars weren't trying to kill everyone anymore.

They were organizing them. Containing them. Preparing them for something else.

Something worse.

Trick rode through the darkness and tried not to think about what came next.

But she couldn't stop the thought from coming anyway.

This wasn't random destruction.

This was systematic control.

And whatever was controlling the cars had a plan that was only starting to unfold.
