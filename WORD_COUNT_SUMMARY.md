## Analysis

### Strengths
- Chapters 1-14 are well-developed (2,345-3,524 words each)
- Consistent pacing in the first two-thirds of the book
- Strong character development in early chapters

### Areas for Improvement
- **Chapters 15-19 are significantly shorter** than the rest
  - These chapters average only 1,286 words vs. 2,800+ for earlier chapters
  - Chapter 19 is particularly short at 899 words
  - These chapters may need expansion to match the depth and pacing of earlier chapters

### Recommendations

1. **Expand Chapters 15-19** to reach the 2,500-3,500 word range:
   - Add more internal monologue and character development
   - Expand action sequences with more detail
   - Include more world-building and atmosphere
   - Deepen emotional moments and character interactions

2. **Target Word Counts:**
   - Chapter 15: Expand from 1,992 to ~3,000 words
   - Chapter 16: Expand from 1,281 to ~3,000 words
   - Chapter 17: Expand from 1,127 to ~3,000 words
   - Chapter 18: Expand from 1,132 to ~3,000 words
   - Chapter 19: Expand from 899 to ~3,000 words

3. **If expanded, projected totals:**
   - Additional words needed: ~10,000 words
   - New total: ~60,000 words
   - New page count: ~240 pages
   - New status: Standard Novel

## Notes

- Chapter 6B is a transition chapter, so shorter length is acceptable
- The script (`count_chapters.ps1`) can be run anytime to get updated counts
- A CSV file is generated with each run for detailed analysis

## Next Steps

1. Review Chapters 15-19 for expansion opportunities
2. Complete remaining chapters (20-27) per outline
3. Run word count script again after revisions
4. Aim for consistent chapter lengths in final draft
